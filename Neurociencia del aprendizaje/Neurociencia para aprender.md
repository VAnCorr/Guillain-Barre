"Stella points out that what we don't know about how the brain works is
greater than what we do. In this third edition she continues to shed a
warm and welcomed light on the unfolding science. She unpacks the myths
and uses the available evidence to provide practical suggestions to
address modern day learning challenges. This indeed is a book for those
who want to keep curious, keep pragmatic and keep learning!"

Laura Overton, Award winning learning analyst and Founder of Learning
Changemakers

"Neuroscience underpins psychology and is the foundation for our
understanding of how the brain functions and how it supports learning.
It can be used to inform learning design and strategies and Stella does
a great job in relating the science to learning. Great to see AI being
included as neural networks drew from neuroscience and it promises to
play a major role in the delivery of learning."

Donald Clark, CEO, Wildfire Learning

*"Neuroscience for Learning and Development* by Stella Collins is the
ultimate guide for unlocking the power of the brain to optimize
learning. Collins has taken complex neuroscience concepts and
transformed them into a practical and easy-to-adopt guide that includes
real-world examples and strategies. This comprehensive resource is
essential for educators, []{#00_PRELIMS_s1_Endorsement.xhtml_page_ii
.pagebreak aria-label="Page ii" role="doc-pagebreak"}trainers, and
anyone who wants to enhance their learning abilities. Don\'t miss out on
the opportunity to revolutionize the way you approach learning and
development."

Jocelyn Darbroudi, Chief Information Officer, IT

"It\'s my assumption that every professional is keen to master the
fundamental knowledge of their industry. For learning professionals this
would mean that they understand the essential processes of how the brain
works while learning. So, if you consider yourself a learning
professional the question is not if, but, when will you read
*Neuroscience for Learning and Development*? Now updated with the latest
insights and a very relevant extra chapter on 'Learning to learn'.
Stella Collins keeps offering great value with this book. A must read
for every learning professional."

Ger Driesen, Learning Innovation Leader, aNewSpring, co-founder,
Challenge Leadership Development Academy

"Stella has taken a complex topic and made it understandable and
enjoyable for learning professionals, with takeaways that can be used
immediately. I'm grateful that the edition has been updated reflecting
the current context we are all working in and the latest research. With
a keen eye for what's important in learning transfer this is a
worthwhile read, and a book to definitely implement your learning from."

Emma Weber, CEO & Founder, Lever -- Transfer of Learning

"In this third edition, Stella Collins masterfully incorporates current
and highly relevant developments in the field of learning, such as
advancements in AI and digital learning. By seamlessly blending
scientific insights from neuroscience with a practical approach, Stella
makes this knowledge accessible and engaging for L&D professionals. This
updated, contemporary edition is a must-read for those looking to stay
ahead in the ever-evolving world of learning and development."

Vivian Heijnen, Managing Director Tulser Global, Partner Solutions
Engineering

"Stella Collins has done an exceptional job in bringing together the
latest research in neuroscience and applying it to the world of learning
and development. This book is a go-to resource for anyone interested in
understanding how the brain works and how we can use this knowledge to
enhance our ability to learn and grow. With clear explanations and
practical examples, Collins makes even the most complex concepts
accessible and applicable. Whether you are a trainer, teacher, or simply
someone who wants to improve your own learning, this book is a
must-read. I highly recommend it!"

Caroline Ford, Global Head, Skills, Novartis Learning Institute

"Learning has always been one of the most important and complex things
we do in life. *Neuroscience for Learning and Development* unlocks many
of the secrets and gives us important insights to make all our learning
programs more interesting, useful, and long-lasting."

Josh Bersin, Global Industry Analyst

"It is a major achievement to sustain a book on neuroscience through
three editions over 6 years. Research on Neuroscience is exploding, and
ideas around learning and development are dramatically evolving to meet
the needs of changing organizations in a changing world.

The overwhelming sense you get from reading this third edition is just
how relevant the ideas remain and how useful the book is as a dynamic
overview of what we know and, more importantly, what we should do as a
result of this knowledge.

There have been the usual updating and deletions for this third edition,
as well as an enhanced chapter on digital learning (as there should
be!). However, what makes it special and differentiates it from the
previous two is a whole new chapter on 'Learning to learn'. It explores
the area comprehensively for the simple and obvious reason that: 'The
skill of learning is the gateway skill to all other skills.' In some way
it is the pivot around which the book hinges and should be at the core
of all learning practice. It is a powerful and helpful addition."

Dr Nigel Paine, author, Workplace Learning, learning professional,
Presenter of Learning Now TV and the From Scratch Podcast with Martin
Couzins

"Understanding the neuroscience and psychology of the learner is the key
to successful learning and training."

My world feels like a very different place since writing the first and
second editions of this book. The first edition was written in the UK
and I was still mainly training face-to-face, though we'd started
experimenting with online sessions. I wrote the second edition in Spain
where digital communication and learning had necessarily become a much
bigger part of my world due to having clients in different countries.
This third edition has been written since moving to Belgium and after
the Covid-19 pandemic when, for a time, digital learning became the only
option for many. Additionally, I'm now co-founder and CLO at Stellar
Labs where our team of learning scientists and IT specialists have built
and continue to develop a learning transfer platform fuelled by
neuroscience. Learning technology has become a much bigger part of my
life and possibly yours too.

When I re-read the second edition as part of the preparation for this
third one I really noticed my own shifts in thinking and how the world
of learning has changed.

For many of us the biggest change over the past few years has been the
impact of Covid-19 and how it significantly accelerated the use of
digital technology for learning. Before Covid-19, while some
organizations embraced technology, it could be an uphill battle with
others to persuade them to try new technology; possibly because of a
lack of experience, a fear that their people wouldn't embrace it and
often because the technology itself wasn't always up to scratch.

While organizations are now returning to some face-to-face activity
again, most have adopted a pragmatic approach and are benefiting from
blending their delivery; choosing the best option for the situation.
Organizations are more open to modular delivery and creating blended
learning journeys which are more suited to our brains' learning
processes than a full fat, big bang, one week face-to-face training
course. This feels like a positive step forward towards creating mature
learning cultures where learning happens more often in the flow of work
and less as isolated events.

Despite the changes we've all experienced, as always, some things remain
the same because fortunately the pace of human evolution is much slower
than the pace of technological evolution. Learning, from the point of
view of our brains and bodies is pretty much the same as it has always
been. It's []{#00_PRELIMS_s15_Preface.xhtml_page_xiv .pagebreak
aria-label="Page xiv" role="doc-pagebreak"}true that neuroscience itself
also advances rapidly with new research results every day, but the
foundations remain relatively stable. For instance, there is relatively
new evidence that some learning happens at the dendrites rather than
only at the synapses, but this is going to make very little difference
to your professional practice.

Based on an increased drive in many organizations to promote
self-directed learning and pull rather than push learning there's a new
chapter called Learning to Learn. As people are encouraged to learn for
themselves more, this is a foundational skill that underpins everything
we learn. When we have effective strategies to learn in different
contexts, we don't waste time, money or energy by learning inefficiently
and can make the most of experiences, content, resources, e-learning and
learning programmes.

To keep the book to a sensible size I've necessarily had to take out
some elements and those were mostly examples of face-to-face training
that felt a little outdated in our current world. Thank you again to all
those people who contributed stories for the original and second
edition. Face-to-face training still has value to bring in physical
learning and particularly to build social connection but there are many
other options open to us now that, when done well, can support
brain-friendly learning and deliver organizational results.

While you read the book, I invite you to be creative and curious and
consider how you can apply evidence-based learning and brain friendly
principles to whatever you design and however you deliver it. Think
about how you can adapt these ideas to create environments and cultures
which enable people to learn in the workplace as a normal part of their
day.

As L&D professionals we'll never be able to keep up with all the latest
discoveries in the growing field of neuroscience, but if we continue to
challenge, ask good questions and keep ourselves open to new ideas we'll
be better equipped to help our colleagues, clients and ourselves learn
and perform better at work and outside.

The Oscar speeches always make people laugh because there are so many
people to thank and now I know how those actors and directors feel...
'Thank you' to my mum and dad for setting me on a journey of exploration
and I'm sorry for all the times I asked 'why?' and I'm grateful for your
patience in answering.

Lots of people contributed directly or indirectly to the book, starting
with the many clients, friends and colleagues who ask questions,
challenge, share their ideas and make training and learning a great area
to work. Special thanks to Ann Grindrod who gave me my first real
training role and taught me a huge amount about the practical side of
training.

Thanks to my co-founder Raf Seymus and all my colleagues at Stellar Labs
who keep me on my toes as we collaborate on our exciting journey, and
who've encouraged me to take the time to finish this third edition.
Normal service will be resumed soon.

Thank you to a number of people who've both challenged and supported my
thinking over the past few years either through conversations over a
glass of wine, in podcasts or their own writing. I'd particularly like
to thank Laura Overton, Donald Clark, Ina Weinbaeur-Heidel, Mirjam
Neelen, Don Taylor, Emma Weber and Ger Driesen.

I'd like to thank all those neurosceptics out there who keep me on my
toes and challenge me to check my facts. I apologize to you where I've
missed something or caused any mistakes or misconceptions, but at least
it will give you something to tweet, blog and shout about.

Special thanks to my supportive husband Nick, who never seems to doubt I
can do what I set my mind to, and to our daughters Alice and Genevieve
who were always willing to listen and join in my experiments; you're
both the best experiment we've ever worked
on.[]{#00_PRELIMS_s16_Acknowledgements.xhtml_page_xvi .pagebreak

Do you know that when you're curious it's as much of a buzz as a bar of
chocolate, a game of tennis or a flutter on the horses? Why do we find
curiosity so pleasurable? When we are curious our brains are stimulated
by dopamine, a neurotransmitter that works on our internal reward
systems; rats find it so addictive they will press a bar to stimulate
dopamine receptors in their brains rather than eat, drink or sleep.
Dopamine is our own internal reward neurotransmitter, and it's just as
addictive for us as it is for rats.

This is wonderful news if you're involved in helping people learn
because so long as you can make them curious you're making learning
enjoyable and they'll want to come back for more, again and again and
again.

## [Your invitation to come on a journey](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_002 .head-a}

I invite you to come with me on a journey of exploration of the inner
workings of your brain and body when you're learning. By understanding
some of the mechanisms of your brain while you process information,
learn, remember and experiment and apply, you will grow and develop as a
learning professional. By understanding some of the neuroscience about
the changes that happen in our brains when people learn, you can design
and deliver far more effective learning journeys. And you might even
learn to learn more effectively yourself.

We all learn -- it's in our human nature -- because if we didn't learn,
we wouldn't survive. Even the simplest organisms learn in order to avoid
being []{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_2 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 2"
role="doc-pagebreak"}eaten or hurt by predators in a dangerous
environment. As we've progressed from living in caves to our current
digital age, have we got into some habits in education and training that
might be stopping people from learning in the most natural way? With the
growing interest and research in neuroscience, the body of evidence to
help us devise the most effective learning environments has grown, and
it's up to us, as professionals, to take advantage of all that knowledge
and new information.

What you'll get by reading this book are practical ideas to implement,
in the face-to-face or virtual world of learning, from some of the
neuroscience available to us. You'll find research to back up what
you're already doing, to inspire you to try new things and maybe even
some things that you might decide to stop doing. With this new knowledge
at your fingertips, you'll increase your credibility with peers and also
with your managers, clients or sponsors because you'll have objective
evidence to support what you do in terms of changing behaviours,
increasing knowledge and improving skills. You'll also be able to
influence your learners by explaining exactly why you're asking them to
participate in particular activities.

You'll get answers to real-life challenges, like how to get managers to
be more involved when people come back from training programmes, how to
persuade clients that you can't train an entire new system just with a
two-hour presentation and how to motivate and persuade sceptical people
that compliance training can be cost-effective and enjoyable at the same
time.

Throughout the book I'll start with an outline of each chapter and

## [Who you are as the reader](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_003 .head-a}

This book has been written for people like you who are learning
professionals in a variety of roles and environments. You might be a
learning and development manager, human resources director, a trainer in
a team, a digital or e-learning designer, an independent trainer, an
independent development consultant, working in organizational
development, a coach, a teacher, a university lecturer or someone who
develops technical knowledge or skills with colleagues as part of
another role. You may be someone who's learning for yourself, either
through a formal education route, for work or perhaps
[]{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_4 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 4"
role="doc-pagebreak"}even for pleasure, and you want some ideas to keep
you motivated, to help you take in information and to make it stick so
you can apply it when you need to.

You may train communication skills like confidence, persuasion or
negotiation or you may train business skills, presentation skills,
leadership skills, supervisory skills or it could be skills related to
particular roles like customer service or sales. You might be teaching
product knowledge or doing operational training like health and safety,
compliance, or finance updates. You may be creating digital, online
experiences or designing virtual reality environments. Perhaps you spend
time working in virtual classrooms with webinar or conference
technology. You may spend your time working on attitude change and
shifts in belief, whether that's at a senior level or more widely in a
change programme. Perhaps you're a coach and are encouraging other
people to come up with ideas, options and possibilities. You might be
working on the shop floor with apprentices or with PhD students or chief
executives and you're sure to be working with a diversity of people.
Perhaps you work digitally and design and deliver e-learning, video,
virtual reality or online workshops. However you work, whoever and
whatever you design for, train or teach, you have one thing in common --
you're changing brains, whether that's your intention or not.

You're probably not a fully trained neuroscientist though you may, or
may not, have some knowledge of psychology, memory, learning or
educational principles. Like me, you are probably curious about new
ideas you can pick up to develop your practice and skills; after all,
that's why you are reading this book.

Most of the time I'm going to use the generic word 'trainer' to describe
readers like you, who help people learn, develop or change their
behaviours. It's easier to read than having to plough through trainers,
learning and development professionals, human resources professionals,
digital designers, learning facilitators, educators, coaches, lecturers
or anything else you may call yourself. I hope this works for you; if
not, then please substitute your own word every time you see 'trainer'.

I'll refer to learning, training and sometimes education but whichever
word I use I'd like you to think about your role as a professional who's
there to help other people learn. You can't learn for them; you can only
create an environment that makes it easier for them to learn and
understanding some of the results from neuroscience research can help
you be more effective. I hope after reading this book you might change
some of what you do, develop what you do, start something new or even
drop something altogether []{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_5 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 5" role="doc-pagebreak"}because you'll have a framework
and some evidence to back up and support what works for learners, their
organizations and you.

## [Why this book has been written now](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_004 .head-a}

For a long time, training, learning and education have felt a bit like
the poor cousins of finance, sales and operations; often the first
department or activity to be cut when there are cost reductions
happening. While not impossible, it is notoriously difficult to measure
the return on investment in training because so many other factors
contribute to improved performance and so sometimes trainers struggle to
get budgets or persuade other colleagues to take their services
seriously. I'm sure I'm not the first trainer to arrive at a workshop to
be told that one or more of the participants has been called away to an
'urgent operational matter' or that 'I just have to pop out to a really
important meeting -- hope you don't mind'. It leaves you feeling
powerless because clearly everyone else in the environment sees training
as a 'nice to have' rather than a 'need to have'.

Some things are harder to measure than others. Everyone recognizes that
airline pilots need to be taught to take off and land accurately but
there's less emphasis on making sure their soft skills are up to
scratch. Robert Cialdini (2001) in his book *Influence: Science and
Practice* talks about 'captainitis': the tendency for other crew members
to allow their own expertise, training and common sense to be overridden
by the lead of the captain, often leading to serious errors and even
crashes. If they were given more training in the so-called 'soft skills'
of recognizing and challenging human behaviour it is possible they would
avoid some of these accidents.

Happily, now there is growing emphasis on the value of people skills
along with technical skills and the global corporate training spend is
estimated to reach \$487 billion by 2020. So, we need to train the
trainers and educators to create the most impact from that spend; so
there is more evidence mounting that training in these areas is vital
and training the trainers ought to be at the top of that list.

And of course we've now got the neuroscience research, data and logical
analysis to show that soft skills aren't soft at all. They are grounded
in neuroplasticity, priming, memory research, cognitive psychology,
social psychology and the nuts and bolts of what goes on in your head
when you communicate with someone. There are numerous books published
now about neuroleadership, neuroeconomics and how your brain works at
work []{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_6 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 6"
role="doc-pagebreak"}and organizations are beginning to recognize that
how we learn is just as important as what we learn. The Chartered
Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) brought out three research
reports between 2012 and 2014 describing the impact that neuroscience is
going to have on learning. In the third report, Neuroscience in Action
(CIPD, 2014), the final conclusions say:

> Despite the great case study examples featured in this report, we have
> found that there are very few organizations openly using neuroscience
> in practice. There are two explanations for this. Firstly, perhaps it
> is simply too early for widespread adoption, and there is a
> knowledge--application gap. Or secondly, that many of the overall
> principles of neuroscience are finding their way into L&D practice
> without being labelled as such.
>
> (*Neuroscience in action: Applying insight to L&D practice* (2014))

Bringing you up to date in this third edition, the CIPD and other bodies
now actively promote the practical application of neuroscience as one of
their core topics and are working to bust many neuromyths and older,
less evidence-based models of learning. So this book is here to help
fill some of those gaps.

## [The reasons I'm interested in the neuroscience of learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_005 .head-a}

This area fascinates me because I'm curious and was brought up asking
questions about learning. A long time ago my dad, who was a teacher,
brought home some coloured, wooden blocks to help me with my 'number
bonds' because I was struggling with multiplication. I remember the feel
of them, the bright colours, the sound they made as you shuffled them
around and even the smell. Using those blocks helped me get past the
struggle I'd had with numbers; and I still do multiplication by working
in blocks of numbers. Having a dad as a teacher meant we talked about
learning a lot at home and my dad knew that children needed to be
'doing' to learn, but his methods weren't always popular and he didn't
have lots of measurable evidence to back up what he said -- apart from
the children who flourished. So I spent years listening to my dad and
unconsciously learning about how people learn, but there was no way I
was going to be a teacher because most of my experience of formal
learning was essentially someone talking and writing key points on a
blackboard -- commonly known as 'chalk and talk'.

[]{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_7 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 7"
role="doc-pagebreak"}At university I studied Psychology and
Communication and became fascinated by how our brains work; both the
real physical hardware and the processing or software. But despite the
interest in brains I took a tangent and began my working life as a
computer programmer. Like many others at the time, I endured multiple
two-week-long training courses, most of which we sat through just
itching to get back to work so we could experiment for ourselves and
really get on with learning. We didn't find being talked through
screenshots any more effective as a learning tool than the
chalk-and-talk method.

My career took me in the direction of technical support and eventually I
was given the role of 'Training Manager' which I didn't want because my
experience of training hadn't been engaging and I didn't want to inflict
similar experiences on my colleagues. I kept up to date with the world
of psychology though and was curious to see how psychology might be
useful but didn't have a clear route to making training more engaging
until, at a training exhibition, I came upon a pirate ship! The pirate
ship was full of trainers who used accelerated learning methods to train
subjects that some people considered traditionally boring, like finance
and accounting. But these 'pirates' brought their subjects to life and
made them a) fascinating and b) easy to learn. Suddenly I realized there
was a way of bringing psychology and neuroscience into the training room
and I'm still hugely grateful to them for catapulting me into the
fascinating, exciting and collaborative world of learning. Since then
I've worked with thousands of people and many trainers keen to introduce
brain friendly learning to their working methods. I created the Brain
Friendly Learning Group as a way of sharing research, good ideas and
challenges and people kept asking whether there was something they could
read to bring the ideas together. Now I'm co-founder at a company
building a digital learning platform with its feet planted firmly in the
neuroscience of learning.

I want to share research, stories and practical examples of how
neuroscience is being used in training and learning and to stimulate new
ways for you to implement them in your practice -- wherever and with
whoever that may be.

This is just the start of a journey for all of us who teach others and
I'm still curious as to what else we can learn, how we can apply it and
what the results are for our learners, organizations, communities and
perhaps even nations.

## []{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_8 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 8" role="doc-pagebreak"}[The definition of neuroscience for this book](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_006 .head-a}

It seems that neuroscience has changed over the years. When I talk to
people who studied psychology in the 1980s at about the same time as me,
the view is that it was about the actual brain and how it works. It was
seen as the science of what could be observed and measured in the
physical brain and nervous system; it was the electrical and chemical
activity, the anatomy and structure and the neurotransmitters and
hormones that had an effect on the brain. Neuroscientists might record
from electrodes placed in the nerve cells of snails and other simple
organisms in order to understand how neurons work. They could devise
mathematical models for the transmission of electrical signals in
neurons of the giant axon of a squid. They could mess about with the
brains of rats and see what that did to their behaviour and they could
dissect brains to identify the structures or look at brain scans to
identify activity in certain areas; in short the biology of how the
brain works.

However, in recent years this definition has expanded considerably.
Wikipedia suggests it's now 'the scientific study of the neurosystem'
and it's become a blend of many disciplines including psychology,
physiology, philosophy and even computer science, engineering and
physics. It may be that it's the brain scans that have expanded this
view of neuroscience. Some research suggests that people give more
credence to pictures of brain scans than any number of equally useful
cognitive psychology findings, so other scientists interested in how
brains work may have picked up the 'neuroscience' label almost to
validate their own findings with the general public (Munro and Munro,
2014).

## [What you'll find on this journey](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_007){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_007 .head-a}

In this book we're going to take this wider view of neuroscience because
some of the studies that help us understand learning and training are
behavioural, cognitive and social rather than purely biological, and
therefore you'll get a far wider and more realistic view of the
information that's currently available to us. (See [Chapter
2](#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml) for more about neuroscience.)

As you read through you'll come across some of the slightly messy,
squidgy hardware of the brain. The hardware relates to the biology and
physiology of your brain, your nervous system and the chemical
interactions of neurotransmitters and hormones.

[]{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_9 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 9"
role="doc-pagebreak"}You'll also delve into some of the software of your
brain as it relates to learning and what cognitive psychology,
developmental psychology and behavioural psychology have to say about
learning. What's the latest in memory research? How will an
understanding of social psychology help you create more effective
learning environments, whether face-to-face or digital? How does your
conscious and unconscious awareness of the world around you affect what
you perceive, how well you learn and how you behave?

The focus will be on applying this neuroscience to the practical world
of learning, education and training. How will you improve people's
memory for information? How will you help people develop new habits? How
can they forget old ones? How can neuroscience influence such old
chestnuts as how to get managers involved in training and how do you
design and train technical or compliance topics without being boring or
getting stuck in the detail? What can the world of digital and virtual
learning pick up from the application of neuroscience? (Despite the
advances in technology you are still working with physical, messy brains
that haven't changed much over the millennia).

I urge you to use this book as a starting point and to investigate
podcasts, videos, blogs, papers and other books that expand on the
subject. Talk to your colleagues; mix with neuroscientists and other
academics; take part in discussion groups; attend conferences; attend
un-conferences; and challenge, question and experiment yourself. Do
whatever you can to improve your training and to help other people
learn. Learn how to exploit and apply scientific evidence for learning
success.

## [A start on the 'How can I...?'](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_008){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_008 .head-a}

You've already discovered that dopamine is released when you are curious
but how can you make people curious and is there a discernible effect on
their learning? Will questions like this one help? Let's explore a piece
of genuine scientific research and a much more practical piece of
research in a real learning environment and see what we come up with
that you can use in your environment.

When you're asked a question do you try to guess the answer? Or do you
encourage others to guess when you're asking the questions? Is it good
practice to guess or is there a danger that people might guess the wrong
answer and then remember it?

[]{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_10 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 10"
role="doc-pagebreak"}It seems, perhaps counter-intuitively, that we
learn better after guessing, even if we guess the wrong answer first.
Researchers at the University of California (Yan et al, 2014) tested
whether people learnt better when they were shown two linked pieces of
information or had to guess the answer to a question such as 'What is
the capital of Brazil?'. They had either to guess the answer for eight
seconds and were then shown the correct answer, Brasilia, for five
seconds, or they were simply shown the linked information 'Brazil --
Brasilia' for 15 seconds. Which condition do you think improved the
recall of the correct answer when people were tested later? It turned
out that even when people guessed the wrong answer to the question,
often Rio de Janeiro, their recall was better than when they'd simply
been shown the correct information. And this effect persisted for up to
61 hours afterwards. (They didn't measure any further than that.)

We put this theory to the test in a 'Brain-friendly Masterclass'
workshop (thank you to Sue Daly of Resolution for Change for asking us
to participate in her experiment) and our experience seemed to tally
with the research. In our small-scale experiment we were first asked a
difficult quiz question and told to guess the answer, but not to reveal
it. Then we were given another guess at four options. Finally we were
shown the answer to check if we were correct. We identified those
questions we'd guessed correctly and those we'd guessed wrong.

Four hours later, after a significant amount of other new information,
we were tested again on the same questions. While ours wasn't a
scientifically rigorous experiment, the results were broadly similar to
those of the researchers; we could remember the correct answers we'd
guessed at four hours later. The current explanation for this finding
seems to be what's called 'semantic activation', whereby a mental 'web'
of knowledge and facts associated with the correct answer is activated
and leads to better storage of the correct information. The researchers
at the University of California said: 'The basic idea is that this
\[guessing-related\] activation... affords a richer encoding of the
subsequently presented target'.

A question that arises is: were people curious as they guessed as to
which was the right answer and did that release a shot of dopamine which
somehow made the facts more enjoyable and more memorable? We don't know
because that wasn't being investigated by this set of researchers and
you can't create hypotheses in hindsight, but it's an interesting
thought.

## []{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_11 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 11" role="doc-pagebreak"}[So what? -- takeaway ideas to experiment with](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_009){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_009 .head-a}

Let's start to put this into your context. Scientific research is all
very well but what does this mean for you in a practical learning
situation?

Try this experiment: rather than telling a colleague something at work
and expecting them to remember, instead ask them a question and invite
them to guess. Whether they guess right or wrong, show them the correct
answer. The research indicates they'll remember your information more
accurately if you encourage them to guess first before revealing the
correct information. And it doesn't even matter if they guess wrongly at
first -- so long as you present the correct information quickly after
the guess, there's a stronger possibility they will remember it more
accurately later.

This is also an easy tactic to implement in a digital environment. Ask
the question and prompt the learner to guess before they click on or
reveal the answer. You don't even need to record whether they got it
right or wrong because guessing itself will improve their chances of
remembering.

## [How to navigate this book](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_01_CHAP_C01_h2_010){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml__01_CHAP_C01_h2_010 .head-a}

If you've got plenty of time or this is really important to you, read
the book from beginning to end. Each chapter has an overview, research
nuggets relating to the topic and you'll find 'curiosities' -- pieces of
research that are fascinating, potentially challenging or just seem to
be unexpected for our current levels of knowledge.

There are stories and case studies because the research shows that
humans relate to stories which are usually more 'sticky' than facts,
though there'll be plenty of facts too. There are plenty of questions to
stimulate your thinking and help with memory -- can you remember what
neurotransmitter is released when you're curious? There are takeaways,
top tips and ideas to experiment or try out -- ideas you can implement
with your learners. Some will be specific to particular areas of
learning or training and some will be more generally applicable, whether
you're working face-to-face, digitally or remotely.

At the end of each chapter, you'll find key points to help you summarize
what you've read in order to boost your memory.

Alternatively, you can choose to dip in and dip out, choosing chapter
headings that relate to what you do, or perhaps use the summaries or
[]{#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml_page_12 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 12"
role="doc-pagebreak"}headings as another way of identifying what that
chapter might hold for you, based on your role and interests.

If you choose to go through in a chronological order you'll explore some
of the neuroscience basics, some of the terminology and ideas that
relate to learning and we'll also question what to do if someone decides
to blind you with science or 'neurohype' and tells you 'research says'.
After that we'll consider some of the key areas in the process of
learning and what evidence there is to show us how people pay attention,
adapt to different ways of learning or create strong memories. You'll
also discover the neuroscience behind some of the other areas that might
affect learning like the face-to-face or digital environments or the
impact people like managers can have on successful learning.

Do you remember what happened in the story of Archimedes when he
suddenly discovered how to measure the volume of an irregular object? He
leapt out of a public bath, and ran home naked shouting, 'Eureka!' ('I
found it!') How about your eureka moments? Can you remember what they
felt like? Hopefully you didn't feel the need to run through the streets
naked, but for most of us it's a very particular experience. When you
have a eureka moment you are literally having a brainwave, but do you
know what sort of brainwave you are having?

Your brain creates electrical patterns which vary in frequency depending
on what's going on in your head. As you do different things, some
brainwaves are more predominant than others; some are faster and some
are slower. It seems that when you have a novel thought or connect two
ideas together, the experience of a eureka moment can be detected as a
particularly high frequency brainwave called a gamma wave. Gamma waves
have a frequency of between about 25 and 100 Hz, as compared to beta
waves (16--31 Hz) or delta waves emitted in deep sleep (0.1--3 Hz).
Curiously, and somewhat counter-intuitively, gamma waves have also been
detected when people are in a state of deep meditation, which may not
immediately strike you as the same experience as a eureka moment, but
people who meditate regularly report strong insights while meditating
which may be related.

This potential contradiction will lead us into a discussion of how
science works and how to assess what's good neuroscience and what's not
in [Chapter 3](#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml). But in the meantime, let's consider
some of the neuroscience building blocks that may be useful to you in
thinking about learning.

Neuroscience is the study of the brain and nervous system and in this
book you're going to focus mainly on the brain. This is because much of
what goes on in learning happens in the brain, though clearly the rest
of the nervous system has a significant effect on the brain and vice
versa and our bodies learn too. But the brain is where we'll start.

### Brain cells {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_002 .head-b}

#### What are brains made of? {.head-c}

Your brain is made of different types of brain cells including several
types of neurons and glial cells which actually make up most of the
physical structure of your brain.

### []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_16 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 16" role="doc-pagebreak"}Neurons {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_003 .head-b}

Until recently, nobody had actually counted how many neurons we have,
though estimates tended to be at the nice, round 100 billion mark
(you'll find out in [Chapter 3](#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml) why you should be
wary of nice, neat numbers). In 2009, neuroscientist Suzana
Herculano-Houzel and her team turned the brains of four recently
deceased men into 'brain soup' (that's what she calls it) using a new
technique called 'isotropic fractionation' (May, 2013). They measured
the number of neurons in samples from the soup and then scaled up to
find that 'on average the human brain has 86 billion neurons'. In a TED
Talk in 2013, she explained, 'Not one \[of the brains\] that we looked
at so far has the 100 billion. Even though it may sound like a small
difference, the 14 billion neurons amount to pretty much the number of
neurons that a baboon brain has, or almost half the number of neurons in
the gorilla brain. So that's a pretty large difference, actually.'

And even with only 86 billion neurons, each able to make multiple
connections, you very quickly get trillions of possibilities as to how
your brain connects up. The neuron is the basic information processing
unit of a brain and, as learning is a form of information processing,
this is therefore a quite important unit to know a bit about.

Neurons were first clearly described by a Spanish researcher, Santiago
Ramón y Cajal in 1888, for which he won the Nobel Prize. Before that it
was thought that the nervous system might be one continuous network.
Cajal built on the work of Camillo Golgi who invented a staining
technique in 1873 which he called *la reazione nera* (black reaction).
This technique is still used today to look at brain cells which look
black against a yellow background. Golgi and Cajal had conflicting ideas
about the structure of brain cells, until electron microscopy in the
1950s proved that brain cells were indeed separate cells, connected at
synapses. Cajal was also a brilliant artist and it is worth seeking out
his beautiful, detailed paintings of neurons.

Neurons are made up of a cell body containing a nucleus and then a
number of branches radiating out (see [Figure
2.2](#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_Figure_2_2)). The longest branch is
called the axon, some of which are short, just a few micrometres, while
some can be up to a metre long, travelling the length of your spine. The
axons have a fatty covering called the myelin sheath which is pinched in
at various points, making it look a bit like a string of sausages. Axons
end in branches called synaptic terminals that transmit nerve impulses
from one neuron to the next one.

<figure id="_02_CHAP_C02_Figure_2_2" class="figure">
<p><span id="02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_17" class="pagebreak"
aria-label="Page 17" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><img

class="referrer" role="doc-backlink"><span class="label">Figure</span>
<span class="ordinal">2.2</span> A neuron</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

The shorter branches are dendrites, which range from a few tens of
micrometres up to several millimetres long. Dendrites collect incoming
information as electrical patterns of activity from other neurons, while
axons send information away from the cell body to other neurons.

The synapses are the junctions between different neurons where
information is passed across. Information travels down the neuron as
electrical energy but many neurons don't actually touch at the synapse
and information passes across by the movement of chemical 'carriers'
called neurotransmitters (more of them later). It's now recognized that
mammals also have synapses where the neurons do touch and electrical
stimuli are able to pass directly between neurons.

### Glial cells {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_004 .head-b}

Glial cells are the support act for the neurons and the most abundant
brain cells we have. You have about the same number of glial cells as
neurons (despite some myths you may read about there being 10 times as
many). The ratio of distribution of glial cells to neurons changes
noticeably from being up to 3:1 parts of the cortex down to only about
0.01 in the cerebellum. They provide structural support, bring
substances like nutrients from blood vessels to neurons and may help in
amplifying electrical activity (but that's still not been proven).
Unlike neurons, they can divide and grow after birth and may be the
structural elements in slow-growing brain tumours as well
[]{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_18 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 18"
role="doc-pagebreak"}as supporting neurons that have been damaged.
However, they don't form synapses and until recently it was thought they
didn't transmit impulses. However, now it seems they do transmit signals
but they are much harder to detect than neuronal signals. In 2022 a team
in Japan (Morizawa et al, 2022) discovered that some glial cells
'nibble' on synapses in the cerebellum in healthy mouse brains which
seems to improve motor learning tasks -- it may be an important part of
synaptic plastisticity.

Their role in learning is like the support teams we all need to create
great learning opportunities. If you're an independent trainer you may
be your own support team so imagine glial cells as those other jobs you
have to do yourself to run a great training programme.

### Networks {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_005 .head-b}

Your neurons form massively complex neural networks that connect,
disconnect and reconnect as we learn, unlearn and relearn. Your neuronal
networks are incredibly important. Even though you'll come across
information suggesting that one part of your brain does one thing and
another does something else it's usually more accurate to talk about
networks or systems that do the work.

### Blood vessels {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_006 .head-b}

Your brain is also full of blood vessels; in fact Hercule Poirot was
wrong when he referred to his 'little grey cells' -- live brains aren't
really grey at all but a pink colour. However, there are still parts of
the brain technically called 'grey matter' which mainly consists of
unmyelinated neurons, glial cells and cell bodies. There is also white
matter, which is mainly made of glial cells and the fatty myelin sheaths
of the axons, and confusingly, in a freshly cut brain, they look
slightly pink too.

## [What's the structure?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_02_CHAP_C02_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h2_003 .head-a}

Brains are hungry organs and seem to consume about 20 per cent of your
body's energy resources while being considerably less than 20 per cent
of your body weight. A human brain weighs about 1.0 to 1.5 kilograms.

Your brain is the most complicated organ on the planet, with the
multiple interconnecting networks performing different functions.
Research continues []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_19 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 19" role="doc-pagebreak"}to identify what's happening,
where, when and how as we go about our normal activities. You'll explore
areas relevant to your learning practice as you go through this book.

There can be controversy over anything that attempts to simplify brain
structures and functions because it is so complex. However, if you're
reading this book you're probably interested in how it applies to
learning rather than being a practising neuroscientist, so you will meet
some simplified models because otherwise the book will have to be much
longer and you'll need to get a PhD in neuroscience.

### Brainstem {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_007 .head-b}

This is the part of the brain that helps to regulate your most basic
functions and to keep you alive. It includes parts of the upper spinal
cord, the brainstem and the cerebellum. Your breathing, hunger,
temperature regulation, basic mobility and balance are all substantially
monitored and controlled in this part of your brain and you're largely
unconscious of what's happening there unless you experience problems
with your normal functioning. Damage to the hindbrain creates problems
with mobility, motor control and central functions like breathing,
sleeping and eating.

[]{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_20 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 20"
role="doc-pagebreak"}For the purposes of learning we don't often think
specifically about the brainstem, but as you'll find in later chapters,
keeping these functions 'satisfied' can prevent interference that may
stop you from performing at your best. Just think about how well you do
or don't learn when you're hungry or too hot.

Significant areas of the brainstem and their main functions are:

- hypothalamus -- regulates temperature, appetite, thirst, hormone
  secretions, muscle fibres

- thalamus -- a relay area that passes messages from our senses into the
  rest of the brain (except smell -- more of that later)

- pineal gland -- our body clock to regulate sleeping, waking and our
  daily rhythms

- pons -- a relay between the cerebellum and the cortex so important for
  movement

- medulla -- controls and monitors respiration and heart rate

- cerebellum -- is crucial for balance and other features of movement.

### Midbrain {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_008 .head-b}

This is a small but vital area at the top of the brainstem that
participates in many processes. A key structure is the substantia nigra
which produces high quantities of the neurotransmitters melanin,
dopamine and noradrenaline. So small doesn't mean insignificant.

### Cerebrum {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_009 .head-b}

The cerebrum is divided into different areas or lobes, each of which has
specific functions. Starting from the back, here are the main lobes and
their key activities. Think about the implications for learning and
you'll revisit them all as you go through this book.

- Occipital lobe -- largely handles visual processing

- Parietal lobe -- seems to be very important for calculations, movement
  and orientation, as well as processing pain, temperature, touch and
  pressure

- Temporal lobe -- co-ordinates your senses, particularly sound and
  speech comprehension and it handles some aspects of memory

- []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_21 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 21"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Frontal lobe -- has no direct connections to the
  outside world and is where you do your thinking, planning,
  decision-making and other higher-level functions

<figure id="_02_CHAP_C02_Figure_2_4" class="figure">

<p>The diagram illustrates a side view of the human brain showing the

the skull. The diagram shows the cerebrum divided into the following
four lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal.</p>
<p>The frontal lobe is the largest lobe located in front of the cerebral
hemisphere.</p>
<p>The parietal lobe is located behind the frontal lobe. The occipital
lobe is the smallest lobe located behind the parietal lobe and at the

and across the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes.</p>

</figure>

Of course the cerebrum is split into two; the famous left and right
hemispheres. Roger Sperry in the 1960s researched the functions of the
different hemispheres and found they process things differently; which
has somehow led to multiple myths about the left and right brain and
even myths about the myths (more of that later) (Gazzaniga et al, 1962).

### Inner cerebrum {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_010 .head-b}

Buried deep within the cerebrum are multiple structures. Some of them
were traditionally referred to as the limbic system but this 'triune
brain' theory (MacLean, 1990) has been largely overridden by more
up-to-date research.

The primary function of this area seems to be preservation of the
individual and possibly the species; that is, it makes sure you are safe
and it is []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_22 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 22"
role="doc-pagebreak"}also crucial in reproduction and nurturing of our
young. If you're interested in learning it's an area you want to pay
attention to because it's particularly associated with memory, emotion
and habits which are crucial to effective learning. You'll come across
many of them again in later chapters.

Structures in this area include:

- hippocampus -- processes memories (much more later)

- a whole range of different nuclei including the amygdala -- strongly
  linked to emotion and particularly fear, rage, aggression and
  sexuality

- corpus callosum -- connects up the two sides of the cerebral cortex

- olfactory bulb -- processes smells

- basal ganglia -- important for body movement, decision making and
  reward.

### Cerebral cortex {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_011 .head-b}

The grey, crinkly, wrinkly cover of the cerebrum is what most people
imagine when you say 'brain' -- it's your cerebral cortex.

The human brain is not the biggest brain in the world -- that honour
belongs to the sperm whale brain, which weighs about eight kilograms --
but we do have the largest cerebral cortex of all mammals, relative to
the size of their brains and if you were to remove the cerebral cortex
and flatten out all those wrinkles (each one is called a sulcus --
plural sulci) you'd have an area about the size of a small umbrella. Our
brains are more wrinkly than other animals so we end up with a larger
surface area of cerebral cortex to do all our complicated thinking.

Your cortex handles higher level processing of sensory information,
emotions, movement, communication, complex thinking like decision-making
and is incredibly important in learning.

Seeing pictures of brains with their different areas mapped out makes it
all look relatively straightforward. However, if you want to see how
very difficult it is to identify different parts of the brain in real
life then the Wellcome Trust has an amazing video dissecting the brain
on YouTube:

## []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_23 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 23" role="doc-pagebreak"}[The brain's messengers -- neurotransmitters and hormones](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_02_CHAP_C02_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h2_004 .head-a}

To function as humans, our bodies and brains need to communicate and
there's a constant chatter of messages up and down your nervous system
and in and out of your brain and body. Chemical messages are carried by
neurotransmitters and hormones, so here are the main ones and their
functions. As with the other building blocks of neuroscience, keep in
mind how they may be valuable for you when you are working in a learning
environment and you'll come across many of them again later.

There are many types of chemicals interacting with your nervous system.
Depending how you count them, scientists now say more than 100
neurotransmitters have been identified and it's a very exciting,
emerging new field of research. However, we'll only cover the most
important and relevant to learning.

Neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, dopamine and noradrenaline,
and hormones, such as oxytocin and adrenaline, are all chemical
messengers. Generally, neurotransmitters are generated by neurons and
work within the brain whereas brain hormones are released by glands in
the body and distributed through the blood to have an effect on the
brain. Neurotransmitters tend to act very quickly and more directly
compared to hormones which have a longer lasting effect that can vary
from a few seconds to several days.

Excitatory neurotransmitters increase the chance that a neuron will fire
while inhibitory neurotransmitters reduce that likelihood. We need both
types because sometimes parts of the brain need to be 'quiet' to allow
other parts to function properly. Your brain doesn't always want to be
actively stimulated.

***Dopamine*** activates your reward systems (remember those poor rats
who preferred a dopamine fix rather than food). It controls arousal
levels in the brain and is vital for physical and psychological
motivation and is implicated in addiction. And, as you've already found
out, it seems to be released when you're curious so is definitely useful
for learning.

***Serotonin*** is your 'feel good', inhibitory neurotransmitter and
affects your mood. High levels are associated with optimism and it's
also important for sleep. Reduced levels are implicated in depression.
Apparently good-quality dark chocolate can boost your serotonin levels
-- we always find this is a popular fact in our 'Train the Trainer'
workshops.

***Acetylcholine*** was the first neurotransmitter to be identified as
such by Otto Loewi, who initially called it Vagusstoff because it was
released from []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_24 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 24" role="doc-pagebreak"}the vagus nerve in the
stomach. You need it to attend to the world around you, learn and
remember and it may help you dream as well as controlling your muscles.
People with Alzheimer's disease suffer from a lack of acetylcholine.

***Glutamate***, or glutamic acid is essentially what gives your Chinese
takeaways their flavour. A Japanese researcher in 1906 evaporated kombu
broth to find brown crystals with a distinctive taste that he named
umami and then went on to produce a synthetic form, monosodium
glutamate. This same chemical, glutamate, is the most abundant
excitatory transmitter in your brain, is vital for linking your neurons
together and is heavily implicated in both learning and memory.

***Noradrenaline***, also known as norepinephrine, is actually a hormone
synthesized from dopamine and released from the adrenal glands above the
kidneys. It has numerous functions throughout the body, including
playing a role in stress and increasing blood flow to the brain. In the
brain itself it helps you pay vigilant attention, a key factor in
learning.

***GABA*** (gamma-Aminobutyric acid) is usually an inhibitory
neurotransmitter that helps to maintain balance and muscle tone and may
have a role in physical relaxation as well as epilepsy. While GABA is an
inhibitory transmitter in the mature brain its actions are mainly
excitatory in developing brains.

Other brain hormones are the ***enkephalins*** and ***endorphins***,
sometimes referred to as our natural opiates. This is because they
modulate pain, reduce stress and can produce a feeling of calm and
relaxation. Like dopamine they are somewhat addictive. Recent research
suggests that endocannabinoids may play a more important part in
learning than previously thought. These are some of the
neurotransmitters that, like the endorphins, are associated with a
runner's high. However, as you'll read later, they may be vitally
important for habit formation.

### Brainwaves {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_012 .head-b}

You already thought about brainwaves right at the start of this chapter.
Brainwaves are the electrical activity set off when neurons are
stimulated by neurotransmitters and hormones. Brainwaves can be detected
as patterns of electrical activity by electroencephalography (EEG). The
activity is caused []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_25 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 25" role="doc-pagebreak"}by synchronized pulses of
electricity from neurons communicating as you think, learn, sleep, dream
and generally go about your daily business. They vary in frequency from
the very slow delta waves which predominate while you sleep, up to the
gamma waves which you've already read about as being prevalent when you
have a eureka moment (see [Figure
2.5](#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_Figure_2_5)). You'll explore later
in the book the 'so what?' -- why it might be useful to consider
different sorts of brainwaves when planning learning.

## [What are some of the tools of neuroscience?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_02_CHAP_C02_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h2_006 .head-a}

When you consider the wider definition of neuroscience (see [Chapter
1](#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml)) that we're using in this book then the tools are
many and varied. However, here you'll find some of the research tools
that are used to peer into your brain. You'll find them referred to in
many studies so it's useful to have an idea of what they are.

### Electroencephalography (EEG) {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_013 .head-b}

You've already met EEG when you read about brainwaves. Essentially,
neuroscientists place small electrodes all over the skull and measure
the electrical patterns happening in your brain. In modern EEG, multiple
readings are taken from across the brain that can be compared to build
up a picture of the activity taking place. Some forms of EEG even pick
up particular []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_26 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 26" role="doc-pagebreak"}patterns relating to a
specific stimulus like a particular touch or even a single word.

### Magnetoencephalography (MEG) {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_014 .head-b}

MEG picks up signals from the oscillation of neurons but this time it's
minute magnetic pulses that are detected rather than electrical signals.
MEG has potential to be very useful because it's fast but is subject to
interference and the signals are weak.

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_015 .head-b}

MRI scanning uses huge magnets to align atoms in body tissue and then
bombards them with radio waves. Different types of tissue give off radio
signals in reaction to this bombardment and computer systems convert the
information into three-dimensional pictures. An MRI brain scan looks a
bit like a greyish X-ray that shows up different types of tissue in the
brain and creates an excellent anatomic picture.

### Functional MRI (fMRI) {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_016 .head-b}

fMRI builds on the basic MRI system by also showing levels of oxygen use
as a measure of brain activity. This means you've got a combination of
anatomic and metabolic information. When specific neurons are excited
they need glucose and oxygen and blood flow is directed to that
particular part of your brain. This blood flow can be detected by fMRI
scanners and allows researchers to see how activity ebbs and flows as
the brain processes information and reacts to stimuli. However, none of
these systems measure in a natural environment so while an fMRI scan can
tell you what's going on inside your head as you read a book in the
scanner, we can't be absolutely sure it's exactly what goes on while
you're reading a book at home. But neuroscientists recognize it's an
amazing opportunity to view our brains while we're actually working at
real tasks.

### Positron Emission Topography (PET) {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_017 .head-b}

PET scans use radioactive markers to see how resources are being used in
your brain as you undertake specific tasks but the drawback is you need
to have a radioactive marker injected into your bloodstream so the
number of []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_27 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 27"
role="doc-pagebreak"}scans anyone can have is limited. They are not
quite as detailed as fMRI scans but because the images are often very
clear and attractive you'll often see them published. They are those
brilliantly coloured red, blue, green and yellow images that look
attractive and scientific and are being used to sell everything from
'brain games' to 'brain safe shampoo'. This causes some neuroscientists
to get very cross because they feel the trappings of science are being
used inappropriately to sell products which don't necessarily have any
research backing them.

Thanks to computers the outputs from scanning systems can be combined
together to create more and more robust pictures of the anatomy and
metabolic processes in our brains and new systems will continue to be
developed.

Here are some other phrases that are useful to define because you will
come across them again in later chapters or in your other research on
the application of neuroscience.

### Neuroplasticity {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_018 .head-b}

Brain plasticity is one of the most exciting concepts in learning
because it goes against the long-held belief that our brains were formed
in critical periods in our childhood and couldn't really change. But
thanks to the ground-breaking work of Marian Diamond (Bennett et al,
1964) we discovered neuroplasticity. In fact now we know about
plasticity it seems hard to imagine how we could explain learning
before. Neuroplasticity is the concept that your synaptic connections
and neuronal pathways change in response to the world around you;
whether those changes are due to the environment, behaviours, thinking,
emotions, learning or physical damage. Literally your brain has the
ability to rewire itself; though don't go away with the idea of thinking
it's easy. If you've ever had to break a habit you'll know that rewiring
your brain can take some time and effort and you need to pay attention.

Paul Bach y Rita is regarded as one of the earliest advocates of
neuroplasticity and has done ground-breaking work in the field of
sensory substitution. Paul was a neuroscientist in New York, his brother
George was a psychiatrist and his father Pedro was a Catalan poet. One
day Pedro suffered a catastrophic stroke and, as was common in the
1950s, the family were told []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_28 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 28" role="doc-pagebreak"}that he wouldn't walk, talk or
function normally again. However, his sons believed that if they could
only get him to rewire his brain they could help him regain his
mobility. So George worked extensively with his father to get him
speaking and moving again. Initially, Pedro couldn't do much more than
drag himself around and you can imagine the scandalized faces of the
neighbours as his sons forced a sick man to crawl across the garden.
However, in time Pedro regained much of his previous functionality and
lived on for many more years. When he eventually died, a post-mortem
showed that the original damaged tissue, largely in his brainstem, had
not been replaced but he had created new pathways to enable him to
relearn his previous skills.

One of the most significant concepts in neuroplasticity, particularly in
associative learning, is that of Hebb's Law, which in its simplest form
says that 'cells that fire together wire together'(Hebb, 1949). At its
most basic it proposes that when two neurons connect regularly they
eventually become permanently linked together -- when one 'fires' so
does the other. You'll come across this principle again in this book.

Ian Robertson, Professor of Psychology at Trinity College Dublin, has
written a wonderfully readable book called *Mind Sculpture* (1999)
looking at neuroplasticity in great detail. One of the things he talks
about is research by Professor Michael Merzenich in San Francisco, which
has shown that in order to change or rewire our brains we need to pay
active attention to the stimuli that can change them. This may seem
intuitively quite obvious to you but until something can be proved by
research, neuroscientists are reluctant to be firm about such
statements.

### Neurogenesis {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h3_019 .head-b}

Another previously common belief was that adults couldn't create new
brain cells which led to that slightly depressing idea that once you'd
been born the rest of your life was just a process of waiting for your
brain cells to be destroyed. However, researchers now know there is an
ability to create some new brain cells, and the subventricular zone
(research shows this might be its primary purpose) and the hippocampus
(primarily involved with memory) have a particular ability to generate
new brain cells, which is great news for all of us. However, you can't
regenerate all your brain cells so you do need to care for your brain;
too many glasses of wine, lack of sleep or knocks to the head are not
recommended.

## []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_29 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 29" role="doc-pagebreak"}[So what? -- takeaway](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_02_CHAP_C02_h2_008){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml__02_CHAP_C02_h2_008 .head-a}

While it's fascinating to spend time researching the functions and
structure of the brain it's probably not really what your day-to-day job
is about. So, what's the takeaway from understanding a little about how
the brain fits together and some of the basic activity going on? How
will you apply what you've read here to working with real people who
need to learn something? How can you apply this to learning
interventions you design and deliver?

Spend a few minutes thinking about what you've read and identify whether
you could make a change to what you do or how you do it. Perhaps so far
all it's done is clarify some terms you've heard or possibly assure you
that how you teach, train or help people learn is already heading in the
right direction. And that's fine because this book is not here to
necessarily change everything you do. One of its aims is to give you a
framework to ground what you currently do in research, data and logic so
that you have justification, evidence and data to back up your work in
the same way that accountants have measures to take to the board of
directors. You don't want to blind your colleagues with science but it
is important that you have the confidence to talk about learning and
teaching people based on what actually happens inside people's heads,
rather than on vague hypotheses or latest trends. This will add to the
professional standing of all of us who work in any field of learning.

As you've been reading this chapter you've learnt:

- Neurons are the building blocks of the brain.

- Neurons are supported by glial cells.

- Neurons connect together at synapses creating a complex neuronal
  network which processes incoming and internal information to keep you
  alive, communicating, thinking and learning.

- The functions of the brain are aided by particular chemicals called
  neurotransmitters and brain hormones which all have their own
  specialities.

- One of the offshoots of this stimulation is brainwaves which can be
  measured by EEG machines.

- []{#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml_page_30 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 30"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Different types of scanning all help to build up
  a picture of the brain's anatomy and functions.

- We've got a lot of current knowledge but there is a lot more for
  scientists to learn about our most complex organ.

For a long time it was commonplace to think that your memory gets worse
as you get older and it seemed to be supported by multiple pieces of
research. When looking at the effects of ageing on memory, researchers
often measure how well older people perform on memory tests compared to
younger people. Cynthia May, Lynn Hasher and Ellen Stoltzfus (1993),
researchers at Duke University in North Carolina, USA, were doing a
meta-analysis of the data from some of these pieces of research, and
came up with an interesting observation. Not only were half of the
subjects young but the researchers themselves were often undergraduates,
i.e. young. One of the results of this observation was that they looked
at the timing of the experiments. Students living typical student lives
had a tendency to plan their experiments for the afternoon, once they'd
had a good lie in, had woken up for the day and were feeling alert.
Older people conversely tend to get up earlier and by the afternoon are
ready for a nap.

So in 1993, May and her team ran the experiments again but this time
invited the 'subjects' to attend in the early part of the day when the
students were feeling groggy but the older people were more alert. And
the previously large gap in results that had been put down to memory
loss due to ageing closed up. Ageing had an effect on memory but just as
significant is the effect on people's sleep patterns and when they felt
alert. Older people tested in the morning were better at memory tests
than when they were tested in the afternoon and younger people tested in
the morning did worse than when they were tested in the afternoon. So
for those of you who've been worried about your memory being
significantly worse as you get older, take heart -- it may not be as bad
as the research first suggested.

## []{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_32 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 32" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Overview](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_03_CHAP_C03_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h2_002 .head-a}

Is there a single piece of scientific research that 'proves' that
learning is improved by spaced repetition or that we learn better when
we're in the right 'mood'? Of course not. It's a bit like asking if
there is a single piece of research to prove how many stars are in the
sky or why small children like ice cream. There is plenty of practical
evidence backing up good training practice, plenty of research that can
be made to fit whatever theory you hold dear and, conversely, there may
be things you do because they work, but, as yet, there is no reliable
evidence to back them up.

Some of the challenges of using research are:

- Assessing which pieces of research relate to what you do and which
  don't.

- Reading some of the academic literature can be very daunting.

- Working out what to do with the research once you know about it.

So what's a responsible trainer to do when faced with an overwhelming
amount of scientific research, not enough time to assess it and people
with budgets asking you to 'prove it' when you say that the online
meeting tool that's been suggested doesn't enable collaboration and
won't be an ideal learning environment? Throughout this book you'll find
practical training tips based on that research and real-world experience
but if you have different experience or an alternative view, then do
what good scientists do and investigate and challenge what you discover.

## [What you'll cover in this chapter](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_03_CHAP_C03_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h2_003 .head-a}

As you'll see in [Figure
3.1](#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_Figure_3_1), you'll read about how
science works in practice and why scientists constantly challenge,
change and evolve their ideas. You'll explore some of the perils of
research such as:

- What is research anyway?

- Research isn't always realistic.

- Research changes the results.

- Simplifying and overgeneralizing results often leads to neuromyths.

- Challenges of neuromyths and how you can be overzealous in seeking
  them out.

- Confusing models and research.

And you'll be given six useful questions to ask when someone says
'research shows' and you want to dig into their assertions a bit deeper.

### It's useful to know how science works {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_001 .head-b}

If you're going to use brain-based research regularly to increase your
credibility then I highly recommend you read Ben Goldacre's *Bad
Science* (2009) first which will help you to assess what's good science
and what's not. It's an excellent introduction to how statistics can be
used and misused in the pursuit of science and it is very likely to
challenge some of your assumptions or beliefs. Be prepared, because
Goldacre takes no prisoners and is equally dismissive of some of the
claims of alternative practitioners and big pharmaceutical companies.

As a learning designer, trainer, teacher or lecturer you're often seen
as the expert -- the person people expect to have all the answers. After
all, you're being paid to help other people learn. So it's sometimes
daunting if someone asks a question you don't know the answer to or
challenges you to back up what you've just said with some evidence. When
you know more about how science works, even if you're not a scientist
yourself, it gives you more confidence to say, 'I don't know,' or,
'There's nothing been proven yet,' or even, 'It's complex and changing.'

[]{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_34 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 34"
role="doc-pagebreak"}In neuroscience, things are rarely proved with a
100 per cent certainty and then remain that way forever. It's a messy,
challenging and exciting discipline that changes, shifts and moves,
sometimes in tiny imperceptible steps and sometimes in huge lurches that
change the way everyone thinks.

Science in general works when someone creates a hypothesis based on what
they already know and a curiosity to find out more. They test their
hypothesis looking for evidence to prove or disprove it. Once the
evidence is there it's put to a peer review process and other people try
to repeat or expand upon the experiments either to prove or disprove the
theory. Eventually enough data amasses that people can begin to say that
a particular hypothesis seems to be robust. Of course, at any point a
new piece of research might come along that throws the original ideas
into question and that's OK because that's how science works -- a
continuous shifting and gathering of evidence, data and information to
come to an agreed point before the next discovery.

In 2012, I remember hearing an excited researcher at the CERN
laboratories being interviewed just before they were about to find out
whether the Higgs Boson existed. The journalist suggested the scientist
would be disappointed if the evidence proved them wrong and showed the
Higgs Boson didn't exist. But the physicist explained he'd be just as
excited if it was proved it didn't exist because that would generate a
completely new way to start thinking about physics. As far as he was
concerned, pursuing good science was far more important and interesting
than any one particular theory. That's not to say that scientists don't
argue volubly if their particular theory is challenged -- that's human
nature.

As humans we're not always comfortable with uncertainty, especially when
we don't have enough knowledge to be comfortable with not knowing. So we
look for simple easy solutions and models that help us explain the
world. And the media makes this even worse by wanting simple, newsworthy
headlines. It doesn't really sell papers when you have an article hedged
with 'maybes' and 'buts' and statistical probabilities. It's more likely
to attract the reader's attention if you can announce, 'Neuroscientists
say modern technology changes our brains!'

### Perils of research -- what do we mean by 'research'? {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_002 .head-b}

The interest in neuroscience in the world of learning should have an
impact for all of us in the way we work. It will give us additional
credibility with all those other measurable disciplines like finance and
sales and it will help us []{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_35 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 35" role="doc-pagebreak"}challenge managers or other
stakeholders who want us to cram vast amounts of content into a shorter
space of time. With the right evidence we can explain that there's no
point showing 30 slides full of data in 20 minutes if we want people to
remember it. Learning is more complex and we can begin to prove it. But
there is a potential overuse of the term 'neuroscience' and particularly
the phrase 'research says'. Not everything that purports to be
neuroscience or research is good science and even if it is good science
it may not be relevant or practical to you working in a real-life
learning environment. Additionally, when someone tells you 'my research
shows', what do they mean by research?

Do they mean research in the sense of market research, surveys and
questionnaires to find out what people think? Do they mean rigorous
academic research? Or do they mean that they've had a bit of a look on
Google and Wikipedia and asked their colleagues? All these forms of
research are legitimate in the sense that they are all ways of finding
out about the world but they are not all neuroscience and sometimes the
term research can be confusing, or worse, might be used to mislead.

Another concern is that the person telling you may have had no intention
to mislead you; they really did mean they riffled around in their filing
cabinet and Google to find something they'd wanted an answer to but you
may have misinterpreted what they meant by 'research'. You might then
tell the next person about a piece of research you'd heard who then
passes it on to someone else as a piece of research they heard which is
then interpreted by someone on a training programme as something
different altogether -- and so the myths are born.

### Perils of research -- simplifying and overapplying results -- poor Albert Mehrabian {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_003 .head-b}

Have you ever seen a silent film such as *The Artist*, which was highly
acclaimed in 2011? Surely these kinds of films show us that we can
communicate through body language alone because nobody says anything.
There's even research that backs up this suggestion -- or is there?

You may have heard that we communicate 55 per cent of what we mean by
our body language and that words account for only 7 per cent of what we
communicate, which might explain why a silent movie can work. Now,
you've probably got one of two reactions if you have heard that
statistic. Either you're nodding and saying, 'Yes I've heard that' or
you're thinking, []{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_36 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 36" role="doc-pagebreak"}'But it's not true!' and may
be about to put down the book. Please stick with me.

This statistic has become mythologized because we're looking for quick
answers and academic papers are hard to read and interpret. So, we often
oversimplify or overapply the results to the wider world and then people
repeat something they've picked up along the way until it starts to
sound true.

The statistic is a genuine result from a scientist called Professor
Albert Mehrabian who published his research in 1971 and inadvertently
started the myth. Somehow it's been isolated from all the other research
about communication and body language and is regularly used,
inappropriately, to explain normal communication when it was a
laboratory experiment under specific conditions looking at a particular
hypothesis. The original research studied a limited range of
communications which were about liking. People were shown
black-and-white photos of a face with a range of emotional expressions;
they also heard a recording of a single word which was in conflict with
the facial expression and voice tones. For example, in the recording,
someone hears the word 'sad' but the tone and facial expression are
'happy'. When subjects saw and heard the clips of mixed messages, they
were more inclined to believe the nonverbal communication (facial
expression and tone of voice) and dismissed the verbal message -- the
single word.

Albert Mehrabian has spent many years explaining that he never intended
this result to apply to normal human communications where, in general,
people's expressions, tone and words are all conveying the same message.
And it was a laboratory experiment; it really wasn't very lifelike.
Albert Mehrabian himself said:

> Inconsistent communications -- the relative importance of verbal and
> nonverbal messages: My findings on this topic have received
> considerable attention in the literature and in the popular media.
> *Silent Messages* \[Mehrabian's key book\] contains a detailed
> discussion of my findings on inconsistent messages of feelings and

If we go back to the silent film, *The Artist*, all the communication is
congruent -- the music, the acting and the occasional words on the
screen are all working to give you the same message. You can tell what
people seem to be saying, up to a point, from the music and images alone
but when someone says something complicated it's just not enough -- we
need the words too.

### Being overzealous about neuromyths {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_004 .head-b}

You may also have heard some of the arguments about left and right brain
myths and I hope you have heard enough to have dispelled the myth that
people are either right-brained and creative or left-brained and
logical, but sometimes a little *more* knowledge can be a dangerous
thing.

On Twitter a few years ago there was a heated debate between two
colleagues over this very topic. Clare mentioned left/right brain
differences and another colleague, let's call him Jack, responded very
quickly and started accusing her of perpetuating the myth of left- or
right-brained people. This wasn't what Clare had said at all but it was
as if just seeing the words 'left brain' and 'right brain' caused an
automatic response in Jack to dismiss her comments without even reading
them or understanding what she was saying. It seems Jack may have
labelled any information about the left and right sides of our brains as
a myth and therefore dismissed anything he read without checking what he
was reading. In reality there are some excellent neuroscientists working
on the similarities and differences between how your two hemispheres
process information but that doesn't mean they are suggesting you only
use one side of your brain or the other.

Some activities are processed predominantly using left hemisphere
processing and some using right hemisphere processing. For example, word
puzzles tend to use the left hemisphere while rotational image exercises
create greater activity in the right hemisphere. Psychologists and
neuroscientists devise exercises to test out these principles and can
see what's happening in the brain with scanners and other detection
systems. But of course in the real world you rarely concentrate on one
limited activity for any period of time -- even if you do a right
hemisphere dominant activity you may then need to access your left
hemisphere (predominant for language processing)
[]{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_38 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 38"
role="doc-pagebreak"}in order to tell someone what you've done. It's
evident that some people find some activities easier to do than others
but it doesn't mean that those people are left- or right-brained.

What do the myths and facts mean to you in your role of designing and
delivering learning? Both of them should get you mixing up activities
and exercises so you're stimulating brains in different ways but without
access to an MRI scanner you're not really going to know whether you're
doing a left-brained or right-brained activity. And, even if you could
tell, what would be the purpose in a world where our brains normally
connect left and right hemispheres?

### Perils of research -- research isn't always realistic {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_005 .head-b}

The huge amount of excellent research done on the study of learning is
not all applicable to workplace learning and/or any learning in the real
world. You'll find out more about the science of learning in the next
chapter but be aware that lots of it will have been done in a
laboratory. And learning sequences of letters or learning to do key
presses in a laboratory is very different to learning about compliance
or customer service at work. Learning research is also often done with
children and can be confused with developmental research; i.e. learning
that happens naturally in the developmental process, such as learning to
speak your native language. It's harder to do learning research with
adults in the workplace because there are many uncontrolled factors and
organizations usually don't have time to carry out controlled trials.

### Perils of research -- the subjects are WEIRD {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_006 .head-b}

Most neuroscience research was initially done with people who had some
sort of disorder or brain damage because they had greater needs and were
the ones who presented themselves to researchers. But they weren't the
WEIRD ones.

Meet the WEIRDest people in the world. They are **W**estern,
**E**ducated, **I**ndustrialized, **R**ich and **D**emocratic. A 2008
survey of the top psychology journals found that 96 per cent of research
subjects were from Western industrialized countries, which accounts for
just 12 per cent of the world's population (Henrich, Heine and
Norenzayan, 2010). And 70 per cent of that population came from the USA
alone and a high proportion of the people included in neuroscience
research are actually psychology undergraduates
[]{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_39 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 39"
role="doc-pagebreak"}because they are the easiest subjects to get hold
of. Applying these results to the personality, behaviour, neuroscience
and psychology of people in general therefore becomes a little less
realistic again. Think back to the story at the start of this chapter
which was about just this sort of problem (if you're over 35 you might
want to try remembering in the morning and if you're under 35 do it in
the afternoon).

### Perils of research -- research changes the results -- just because it's research {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_007 .head-b}

Brain scans look really attractive and it's terribly tempting to think
that because something shows up on a brain scan we can be confident it's
true -- after all we can see it. And surely if researchers have spent
time analysing and collating results we can be sure they're true. They
may be true, but are they realistic? As we've already discussed, a brain
scan is not a normal way of going about anything and the effects of
being studied may change the results.

Back in the 1920s and 1930s a series of experiments seemed to show that
factory workers became more productive when the light levels were
improved. However, analysis by Henry A Landsberger in 1950 showed that
the productivity gains seemed to owe more to the motivational effects of
being studied than the light levels; people's work improved when they
had more interest paid to them. This became known as the Hawthorne
effect and is one of the factors that needs to be considered when
analysing data from real-life studies.

### Perils of research -- beware of cherry-picking {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_008 .head-b}

Like me, you've probably got favourite models that you've used to
illustrate a point over the years and you may or may not have checked
whether there's any scientific rigour behind them -- which may not
matter if it's simply a model that effectively helps you to tell a
story. You probably also use metaphors, analogies and stories to make
information easier to absorb, use and remember and they're all helpful
ways of conveying information. Nobody expects a story to be necessarily
true.

What's more important is that, when someone says their model or their
methodologies have been researched, you need to be sure that the results
weren't cherry-picked to prove their model while ignoring other research
that may provide a different view. This cherry-picking is a form of
selective []{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_40 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 40"
role="doc-pagebreak"}attention and an example of confirmation bias; a
perfectly normal tendency to search for, interpret, or recall
information in a way that confirms your own beliefs or hypotheses. In
scientific circles people look at a range of results to draw firm
conclusions. Often you'll come across meta-analysis of scientific
studies when all the research is considered, both for and against the
hypothesis, and conclusions are drawn based on the weight of evidence.
It helps to avoid cherry-picking individual pieces of research.

Just to be clear, models are a really helpful way to explain the world
-- models are different to science -- they are not reality but just a
possible description that may be useful to help explain something so
they don't need to necessarily be proved. They are definitely better
when they're tested to see whether they fit in multiple situations but
so long as you make it clear it's a model then I think they're helpful.
What you can question is whether any research you're being shown to back
up a model is a wide analysis of available evidence or just a single
result picked out to confirm the model's place in the world.

## [Six questions to ask when someone says 'research shows'](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_03_CHAP_C03_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h2_005 .head-a}

With good science these potential perils are countered by good practice
such as statistical analysis, rigorous controls, double-blind trials and
peer review. Here are six questions to ask when someone says 'research
shows' because not everything that's cited even as scientific research
is as rigorous as it could be. Here's how you can check for yourself if
you are looking at research.

These questions are commonly recognized as useful ways to challenge
research, information and hypotheses and you'll find very similar
questions asked regularly across the scientific community. While each
question on its own may not be entirely helpful, by asking all six
you'll see patterns that add to or detract from the credibility of a
piece of research.

1\. Who did the research?

There are two elements to consider here: who is named as the researcher
and which organization has done the research?

When the research is backed by a major institution like a university or
a major science business you can be fairly confident there will have
been audits, checks and balances, papers published and peer reviews to
demonstrate scientific rigour.

[]{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_41 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 41"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Who appears to have done the research? Has the
person named as the lead researcher (theirs will be the first name on
the paper if there's been one published) been cited in other papers or
other research or is this their first publication?

There's nothing to say that major institutions can't get it wrong.
There's a well-documented case of a renowned researcher at Harvard
University, Dr Marc Hauser, who'd been getting significant recognition
for his long-term studies on monkeys while researching cognitive
evolution. He was forced to resign from Harvard University in 2011 after
he'd been found guilty of scientific misconduct; he'd fabricated data in
one study, manipulated results in multiple experiments, and incorrectly
described how studies were conducted. Interestingly one of his projects
was a 'Moral Sense Test' in which participants were presented with a
series of hypothetical moral dilemmas and asked to judge each one.

Just because the research comes from a smaller company, lesser-known
researchers or universities you haven't heard about before is not
necessarily a reason to devalue the research because everyone has to
start somewhere, but it's worth asking the question.

2\. What's on their agenda?

When an organization's marketing says 'research says our product is
better than others' then it's relatively easy to be aware of the element
of vested interest. However, if it's a piece of scientific research that
shows a particular training tool improves cognitive performance then
it's not readily identifiable as a piece of marketing or a public
relations exercise. However, lots of research is done and funded by
major corporate businesses with a product to sell and the research helps
credibility and sales. This is normal and is why we have regulated
industries with complex compliance and regulatory processes to check
that their research is scientifically rigorous and ethical.

We all have vested interests in some way or another and we can't dismiss
research just because it comes from a particular source with something
to sell. However it's important to be aware and ask yourself, and them,
are there vested interests in the research results?

3\. Where was it published first?

Science research is usually published first in reputable science
journals so that colleagues, peers and other people can look at their
methodology, the results and the interpretation, and this is the process
of peer review. Usually []{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_42 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 42" role="doc-pagebreak"}scientists will attempt to
replicate the work to check that it is reliable and they'll refine and
improve the methodologies. Think of it a bit like lawyers who love to
pick holes in each other's contracts; scientists love to analyse and
find flaws in other scientists' methodologies and results with the aim
of moving the science on.

Research released first to the mass media and not peer reviewed tends to
be less well regarded among the scientific community though there is an
ongoing, heated debate among scientists as to how to do peer review.
Should they publish first and allow the peer review to happen online or
should they go through the more traditional procedure?

When something appears in the mass media it is necessarily going to be
simplified because most of us won't have the time to explore the detail,
but like legal documents, the detail often contains important caveats
and corollaries that may mean the research is only applicable under
certain conditions and can't be generalized.

4\. When was it published and when else?

Have a look at when a piece of research was published. If it's 20 years
old it doesn't mean it's invalid but ask yourself what's happened since?
Was this the piece of ground-breaking research that everyone defers to
and has been replicated many times or was it a one-off and since then
research has gone on to weaken or disprove the theory? For instance,
Hermann Ebbinghaus did his initial work on memory retention back at the
end of the 18th century and you'll probably be familiar with the
'forgetting curve'. If you were to repeat his experiment now you'd
probably get quite similar results but there's clearly far more recent
work on how we remember and forget. And you might be surprised to know
that Ebbinghaus wasn't memorizing interesting, connected and relevant
bits of information -- he was remembering random strings of words. Keep
this in mind because it's helpful to remember scientific studies don't
usually replicate real life; in fact they can't because being studied
changes people's behaviour anyway (Hawthorne effect).

5\. How was the science done?

Have the results been properly analysed? Have the researchers done
double-blind trials or minimized the potential for the placebo effect or
the Hawthorne effect?

Statistical analysis of results is vital to check whether they are valid
and not the result of coincidence or an accidental outlying result. Have
the results been tested against any base data that's required?
Neuroscientists []{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_43 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 43" role="doc-pagebreak"}using fMRI scanning rather
surprisingly have to calibrate their data against that of a dead salmon.
If you're curious about this then look out for the Ig Nobel Prize in
Neuroscience: The dead salmon study (Jha, 2012).

Statistics help to overcome our entirely human tendency to create
patterns where patterns don't exist -- statistics can help you to
identify a genuine pattern against a coincidence. One psychological
phenomenon called salience helps to explain why often we pay attention
to some things more than others because they seem more important or more
familiar and it's one of the reasons we need statistics to identify the
real patterns.

What's the sample size for the experiment? One of the challenges of
brain scanning is that it's expensive so many experiments are only done
on small numbers of people. This means that it's harder to argue that
the effects or results apply to everyone. Remember, most research is
done on WEIRD outliers (Westernized, educated people from
industrialized, rich democracies). This is a bit of a challenge when we
take a single piece of research and then suggest that 'humans' learn
this way or that.

6\. What are the results saying?

When scientists publish research they tend to hedge it with statistical
probabilities and caveats because they know that it's very unlikely a
single piece of research will tell them anything definitively. It's
usually just another piece in a complex puzzle and that's particularly
true of neuroscience because your brain is so complex. Results that show
neat figures are usually worth questioning as to their scientific
validity. An example of this you might be familiar with is the 70:20:10
model that suggests 70 per cent of learning is done on the job, 20 per
cent with other people and only 10 per cent from reading or 'courses'.
It's a helpful model to work from and based on good practice but the
research it's built on wouldn't be considered scientifically robust.

Avoid looking for 'the one true answer' -- real research evolves,
changes and builds on previous research, sometimes overturning it
completely.

So if a piece of research suggests it's a magic bullet or a magic wand
that's going to solve all your problems then go back to the previous
five questions and get better answers.

*Here's a bonus question*: Is this research relevant to what I do and
can I or should I apply it? The fact that something stimulates your
'anterior cingulate cortex' may sound impressive but is it relevant to
what you're trying to do? And how on earth would you be able to tell if
your carefully designed exercise did or didn't stimulate someone else's
'anterior cingulate cortex'? (In []{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_44
.pagebreak aria-label="Page 44" role="doc-pagebreak"}case you're
wondering, your anterior cingulate cortex helps to focus attention and
tune into your own thoughts; it seems to play a role in depression
causing sufferers to lock onto their own sad feelings.)

The chances are, as someone whose job is in the learning world rather
than research, you're more likely to encounter information second or
third hand through blogs or magazines; you won't regularly come across
research by reading an original research paper, and articles straight
from academia can be very daunting. Brain science is really, really
complicated and that's why there are thousands of scientists around the
world studying tiny dislocated pieces. We, as professionals in another
sphere, can't hope to understand it all so we do need people to simplify
it for us, but we also need to be careful about being blinded by science
and seeing 'neuroscience' as a panacea for everything in our world.

It's helpful for all of us to keep an open mind and to question the
research. This helps us sort out the significant from the insignificant,
the real from the hypothesized; it helps to preserve a rigour and to
make sure we recognize the difference between something that's merely
interesting and something that's been proven.

### Top Tips for using brain-based research {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h3_009 .head-b}

Avoid looking for 'the one true answer' -- real research evolves,
changes and builds on previous research, sometimes overturning it
completely. You need to reassess regularly, question what you find out
and check against all the available data.

Keep an open mind -- if the evidence seems to change then you may have
to change your practice or your reasons for doing something. As
professionals we need to be open to learning too.

Take a pragmatic approach -- if something seems to be effective for your
learners, keep doing it. Research sometimes simply confirms what you've
always known intuitively.

Research articles straight from academia can be very daunting so make
use of resources that have done some of the work for you. Use reliable
sources like *New Scientist*, *The British Psychological Society
Research Digest* or books that round up much of the research such as
*Brain Rules* (John Medina, 2008), *Make Your Brain Work* (Amy Brann,
2013), *Your Brain at Work* (David Rock, 2009), *How We Learn* (Dehaene,
2021).

What we don't know about how the brain works is still far greater than
what we do know so it's fine to say 'I don't know yet'.

## []{#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml_page_45 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 45" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Summary](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_03_CHAP_C03_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml__03_CHAP_C03_h2_006 .head-a}

Neuroscience is complicated and as learning professionals we do not have
time to become neuroscientists. Instead, we can become more aware of how
science works, and how scientists make hypotheses in order to experiment
and challenge each other's findings. Become familiar with the perils of
research; be clear about what people mean by the word 'research' and how
research is regularly simplified and overapplied. Think about how
neuromyths come about and how there are even myths about neuromyths. And
consider how research isn't really like the real world; it's often
conducted in unrealistic situations and is populated by WEIRD subjects.
Research itself changes the results and people may be cherry-picking
their results to sway your views.

Have a set of six questions in reserve to ask when you hear
'neuroscience shows':

1.  Who did the research?

2.  What's on their agenda?

3.  Where was it published first?

4.  When was it published and when else?

5.  How was the science done?

6.  What are the results saying?

I was having some squash coaching and it ruined my game; shots I could
hit before went wrong, and the new shots I was learning were hopeless.
I'd focus my feet position, how I held my racket and how to swing, miss
easy shots and give away too many points. It may be a phenomenon you
recognize too and I hoped that this unexpected effect of the coaching
would wear off!

For a while researchers have known that focusing on body movement can
impair performance. This is because we're directing unhelpful conscious
attention to previously unconscious body control. However, it now seems
that even reflecting on your performance, which intuitively seems like a
good idea, may hinder you too because it can also interfere with your
motor skills.

In a study in 2015, researchers found people who were learning to play
some new ball games performed worse than a control group when they were
asked to reflect on their experiences afterwards. After learning the
skill, participants were asked to think or write about their personal
attributes as an athlete or even their emotional experiences related to
the learning. The control group were asked to think or write about
something unrelated to themselves. After the reflection the groups who'd
reflected were less accurate and made more errors than the control
groups when they next played the game. These scientists think that
focusing on what you're doing while learning might actually impact on
your performance because of something called a 'self schema'. This sense
of 'self' isn't just a psychological or philosophical construct but
seems to be found in functional neural networks such as the
temporoparietal junction (implicated in sensory integration) and the
[]{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_48 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 48"
role="doc-pagebreak"}extrastriate body area (processing thoughts about
your body). This research is new and there are many things that need to
be explored in more depth but the researchers think that the self schema
networks are interfering in the motor control required to perform at a
higher level. This is an interesting reflection for those of us who feel
that asking people how they performed is a helpful learning activity.

In this chapter you'll find out what learning is but we'll start with
what it isn't. Then you'll find out about some of the brain biology of
learning and explore some different types of learning that have been
identified and studied. This will help you to pinpoint what types of
learning you're working with and therefore how to get the best results.
You'll also discover a model for the learning process that will provide
a structure for the next few chapters of the book and is a practical way
to help you think about designing and delivering training and creating
learning environments, whether digital or face-to-face. [Figure

### It's not the same as development {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_001 .head-b}

Let's start with exploring what learning isn't or at least what you're
not going to focus on in this book. From before birth you were exposed
to different stimuli and learnt to respond more or less appropriately to
them. Some of what you learnt is developmental; it's part of your normal
maturation process and was going to happen eventually, whatever
happened. Babies learn to speak a language, to walk, to develop a
concept of self and to become adults, whether we want them to or not.
How well they learn and how they fit into society's norms of behaviour
may vary depending on the experiences that mould and shape them but this
developmental learning is almost unstoppable.

However, we're interested in the sort of learning that goes on alongside
this developmental process and continues long after. We're interested in
how we learn skills, knowledge and behaviours that don't just happen
through a normal process of growing, though they are fundamentally
affected by everything we experience.

### It's not quite the same as memory {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_002 .head-b}

Memory and learning are intimately related and if you're interested
particularly in memory then there is a whole chapter (9) devoted to it;
plus you'll find any number of books, programmes, entire university
courses and expert blogs and opinions available. We need our memories in
order to learn but just having a memory isn't enough to qualify as
learning. I can recall the fact that Henry I is buried at Reading Abbey
but it doesn't really change anything about the way I behave or even
what I believe.

As part of the learning process you need to create or encode and store
memories (you'll explore different sorts of memories later) and you need
to recall that memory later to demonstrate your learning, but a memory
alone isn't sufficient to count as learning.

### It's not information or content {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_003 .head-b}

As a trainer you may regularly be asked to add more content to your
training because someone, somewhere thinks everyone needs to know more
than they currently do. This is the lure of 'content' -- you'll even
hear the phrase 'content is king' but it's not. Not if you want learning
to take place. Content []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_50 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 50" role="doc-pagebreak"}is ideas, concepts, facts,
stories which can be presented in complex, multisensory, multimedia and
gloriously varied ways. However, facts and ideas do not become long-term
learning unless something permanent changes in people's brains. You
might have to take a long, hard look at what you're designing to see
whether you are simply delivering information rather than enabling
learning.

On Valentine's Day at school, we used to tease each other about how the
postman was going to need an especially huge van to deliver all the
beautiful and passionate Valentine's cards we'd receive. Perhaps as a
designer or trainer what you've been doing up to now is being the
postman with all those cards, and you turn up at the door ready to
deliver all those endearments. You've got to deliver the cards because
that's your job so you just leave them on the doorstep but you have no
idea whether anyone will ever open them, read them or have a wonderful
romance based on them. Only a few of the special cards were wanted
anyway; in fact the one that was waited for with a yearning heart may
not have been in your post van at all but delivered by someone who
climbed over the mountain of abandoned post, rang the doorbell and
handed the card over personally. Or sadly perhaps the desired card got
buried in the heap and was thrown away unread, unremembered and having
no impact.

Before you've finished this book I'd like you to start challenging those
people who ask you to deliver more content. As a professional, your job
is to deliver the one true-love's letter or to find the key to open the
door, but it's not to keep delivering the letters just because someone
posted them.

## [What learning is](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_04_CHAP_C04_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h2_004 .head-a}

Learning is a process by which changes in your brain allow you to behave
and respond in particular novel ways. All animals, from the simplest to
the most complex, learn and even machines can learn. For our purposes
we're going to focus on human learning but I can't promise you that the
occasional experiment with chimps, rabbits, rats and even slugs and
snails won't creep in from time to time because often the same processes
are taking place.

Learning happens at a cellular level (or possibly even at a sub-particle
level) so the sorts of processes we can see in simple creatures like
slugs who only have collections of cells called ganglion, rather than
brains, can often teach us something useful about what's going on in our
own brains; though []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_51 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 51" role="doc-pagebreak"}the applications of this may
sometimes be hard to tease out in a work or educational context.

Learning creates structural changes in your brain that help you build on
what you already know and change your behaviours based on what you
already do. If you're changing preferences, habits or beliefs there may
even be some unlearning to do.

Over your life you're going to learn many different things. You may
learn which English king had six wives or the order of the periodic
table or how to cook an apple pie. You will learn culturally appropriate
behaviours, like how to speak to your granny when she comes to visit or
how to behave in an interview. You will learn to play sports and how to
ride a bike; you may learn to paint, sing or do quadratic equations. You
will learn who your friends are and who to avoid, or how you deal with
conflict if you can't avoid them. You will learn how to get from one
place to another with or without a GPS. You will learn to amuse yourself
with crosswords, apps or games. You will learn to read and write, to
doodle, to code. You will learn things accidentally like advertising
jingles you can't get out of your head, and you'll probably learn to
deal with your emotions, and perhaps how to tell which charger belongs
to which piece of electrical equipment.

So what's going on in your head while you learn all these different
things?

## [Some of the biology that's useful](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_04_CHAP_C04_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h2_005 .head-a}

### At the cellular level {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_004 .head-b}

For any type of learning you connect up neurons; you change the way your
brain cells communicate; create new synapses and change the way your
brain is organized.

### What sea slugs have taught us about learning {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_005 .head-b}

When you learn something you're basically letting new connections happen
in your brain and you may be weakening some of the older ones that are
not so useful any more.

So, how do neurons connect? Scientists aren't sure about the entire
process but research on sea slugs has proved helpful. While you may not
be very closely related to the sea slug it seems the basic cellular
processes of learning are quite similar. Sea slugs can't learn to play
the piano or learn []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_52 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 52" role="doc-pagebreak"}numerous facts about a new
manufacturing process but they can find their way around mazes and can
learn to react differently to different stimuli.

They don't have brains as you would recognize them, merely collections
of brain cells called ganglion, but the basic mechanisms at a cellular
level seem to be the same. This was somewhat controversially discovered
by Eric Kandel who eventually won the Nobel Prize in 2000 for his work
on understanding the mechanism of how neurons connect. The controversy
arose because applying what he'd learnt from slugs to human learning was
considered somewhat undignified. Now we've identified that we share
significant amounts of DNA with slugs, perhaps it's easier to believe
that sea slug brain cells work enough like our own to make it a
reasonable comparison.

What Kandel and others (Mayford et al, 2012) showed is that when you
learn you change the way your brain cells, your neurons, interact with
each other. With a new piece of learning the ends of a neuron appear to
swell, sway and then split into two, forming new projections which then
connect up with other neurons. Kandel worked on the gill-withdrawal
reflex of his sea slugs and found distinct short- and long-term memory
storage and that the long-term storage could be seen in structural
changes; cell connections were functionally reorganized, depending on
what they were learning.

So for you too, when you learn something, perhaps by reading this book,
your neurons are swelling, swaying and creating new connections that
didn't exist before.

#### What neurotransmitters and hormones have to do with learning {.head-c}

In the space between your neurons, called the synapses, numerous
neurotransmitters and other chemicals are shuttling around performing
different roles too.

For instance, blocking the effects of *glutamate* stops a process called
*long-term potentiation* (LTP) which is the persistent improved
functioning of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. It's a
vital part of how you create memories. Glutamate activates chemicals in
the post-synaptic cell like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and
protein kinases which help you to synthesize new proteins as part of
forming long-term memories. These new proteins are vital for forming
those neuronal connections; they literally help you 'glue' your neurons
together.

*Serotonin* is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that affects mood as well
being required for memory formation. Its role in memory is less defined
and may be more modulatory than that of glutamate but insufficient
levels are []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_53 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 53"
role="doc-pagebreak"}implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Serotonin is the
one that needs *tryptophan* for its production, which you get from dark
chocolate.

*Cortisol*, a hormone required to handle stress, can reduce learning
while oxytocin may help you think more expansively or creatively. You
can increase your *oxytocin* level by giving someone a hug, so perhaps
next time you want to be a bit more creative, give someone a hug first.
Be aware though, the effect doesn't last long; just long enough for the
oxytocin to have an effect before it's taken up again by your neurons.
Oxytocin may also be what helps you learn to trust.

*Noradrenaline* and *acetylcholine* help you to pay attention; you'll
find out more about attention in [Chapter 7](#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml) and
you'll meet acetylcholine again in [Chapter 9](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml) on
memory.

#### Wiring and the importance of Hebb's Law {.head-c}

Donald Hebb was a Canadian psychologist who first published a book
called *The Organization of Behavior* in 1949 and he's commonly seen as
the father of neuropsychology and neuronal networks (Hebb, 2002). He
went to a Montessori school and was a teacher himself, at one point
teaching at a school for so-called 'difficult children'. He took a
slightly different approach to the strict principles of the Quebec
schooling system and used to set more interesting work which he made a
privilege by sending those who were misbehaving outside (presumably this
was considered more of a punishment then than it may be now). After
going to Yale, Harvard and Chicago universities he started work at the
Montreal Neurological Institute where he found that children's brains
that had been damaged could effectively repair themselves but it was not
as easy for adults. He was one of the early pioneers who proposed --
which at the time was ground-breaking -- that we can explain behaviour
through brain function.

You may have heard of Hebb's Law (1949) which in essence states that
'cells that fire together, wire together'. This is effectively a
description of neuroplasticity and a succinct description of what's
called associative learning (more of that later) and the work of Eric
Kandel and his sea slugs helped to explain some of the 'firing' together
principle.

Hebbian theory seeks to describe how once a new connection has been
established it becomes a stronger, faster and more efficient connection
the more frequently that connection is 'refreshed'. So in order to learn
anything vaguely 'sticky' you need to repeat your learning again and
again -- those connections need to be revisited until the cells 'wire'
together.

[]{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_54 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 54"
role="doc-pagebreak"}*Long-term potentiation* is the increase in the
strength and speed of nerve impulses along pathways which have been used
previously. It seems that once a neural pathway has been established
there are numerous mechanisms in place to make sure that those nerve
impulses are transmitted more effectively.

Did you know that fat is good for your brain and one of the mechanisms
for long-term potentiation? Not only do the cells wire together but they
also start to transmit information more efficiently thanks to fat. Our
brains need fat and people who are significantly malnourished perform
worse on cognitive tasks than those who are well fed. You get energy
from fat but your brain also uses fatty phospholipid proteins to
insulate your neurons with a *myelin* sheath so that less electrical
energy is wasted -- a bit like lagging your hot water pipes. As you
learn something and neurons start connecting, the fatty sheath covering
the long axons of your neurons allow the messages to pass along the
axons from one neuron to another more quickly.

At a cellular learning level, rather than at a person-centred level,
there is some new research indicating that Donald Hebb's law may have to
be revisited. Hebb's Law explains learning takes place by modifying the
strength and speed of signals across the synapse (the gap between
neurons). This new research suggests adaptive learning may also take
place in several dendrites near to the neuron and this is a type of
faster, nodal learning (Bar-Ilan University, 2018 and Hodassman et al
2022). This is related to the way learning has been modelled in machine
learning. However, while potentially ground-breaking in the neuroscience
field, this level of deep complexity is highly unlikely to impact on
what we do in the world of work or education. It's a great example of
how neuroscience is making new discoveries all the time and perhaps in
the future might influence how we train people but it's hard to see the
implications at this point.

#### Wiring patterns {.head-c}

All these neurons connecting up form wiring patterns. Nobody has the
same wiring patterns as anyone else but there are similarities as to
what may get wired and where. Experiments with visual illusions show
that particular brain areas are specifically wired, in most people, to
recognize faces versus other objects.

This famous illusion of the vase and faces lights up a particular set of
neurons in your visual recognition pathway when you see the face but as
soon as you see the vase an entirely different set of neurons lights up
(see [Figure 4.2](#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_Figure_4_2)). So
almost everyone uses generally similar areas for recognizing
[]{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_55 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 55"
role="doc-pagebreak"}faces but each person will have their own specific
configuration for specific faces. John Medina in his book *Brain Rules*
(2008) talks about a man having surgery on his brain who had a specific
neuron that fired up whenever he saw a picture of Jennifer Aniston.
Clearly we don't all have a neuron for Jennifer Aniston in the same
place in our heads (in fact, you may not even have heard of Jennifer
Aniston) but most people have a generally similar area of their brain
that is particular for recognizing human faces. Your own experiences and
learning define which specific wiring patterns you have but you'll find
the general pattern and the structures are similar to mine.

Evidence from working with stroke patients has contributed enormously to
our knowledge of how neuroplasticity enables us to create new patterns
if old ones become unusable. While it isn't always possible to regain a
skill or function after a stroke people can 'learn' to use different
neural pathways to achieve the same outcome but they need to work hard
to establish those new wiring patterns.

### Structures for learning {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_006 .head-b}

Almost all of the brain is implicated in learning in some way. However,
one structure that will come up again and again is the *hippocampus*.
This is because it's so important for memory and you'll explore this in
more detail in [Chapter 9](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml). It's also a relatively
unusual part of the adult brain because it seems capable of
neurogenesis, i.e. creating new neurons -- something that used to be
thought of as impossible.

Your *frontal cortex* does all the heavy decision-making and mental
processing that lets you decide what you want to learn and makes you
conscious you're learning. Of course you don't always decide what you're
[]{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_56 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 56"
role="doc-pagebreak"}going to learn, or even that you will learn, but if
you're making conscious decisions this is the part of the brain that's
helping you. The *ventromedial prefrontal cortex* is part of the network
analysing emotions.

Different parts of your *sensory cortex* and the *motor cortex* are
vital whether you're learning skills or information and we'll cover them
in more detail in [Chapter 6](#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml) on the senses.

Your emotional networks and particularly the *amygdala* are vital to
many types of learning because of the role of emotions in learning. If
you do nothing else after reading this book but include emotions in your
training, even for technical topics, you'll already have gone a long way
to help your learners.

You also need to pay attention when you're learning so your *reticular
activating system*, *superior colliculus*, *parietal cortex* and the
*cingulate gyrus* all have a part to play.

You'll come across all these areas in future chapters so, for now, take
note of their names and functions so that your attentional systems will
pick them up later on.

Structural changes in your brain take place as you learn partly because
the number of synaptic connections are increased. Darwin himself noticed
that some areas of wild animals' brains were 15--30 per cent bigger than
in tame animals. Presumably, wild animals have to learn more to stay
alive than tame ones who can just lie back and relax. Professional
violinists have a larger motor cortex in the area of fine movement
control than less musically gifted people. And there's the well
documented case of London taxicab drivers who have done 'The Knowledge'
(a special test of all the roads in London) who have larger hippocampi
than London bus drivers who follow a prescribed route and therefore
don't need to learn all the roads. You'll meet the taxi drivers' brains
again in this book because they are so famous.

### Brainpower {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_007 .head-b}

Learning is a physical set of changes in your brain that includes
synthesizing new proteins, releasing neurotransmitters, and changing
your neurons to generate new connections. You may also have to break
down previous connections and you do all this while you're still using
some brainpower to breathe, to sit up straight and to pay attention to
the person next to you. It's hard work and it needs energy.

A psychology professor, Paul E. Gold and his colleagues E. McNay and T.
Fries (McNay, Fries and Gold, 2000) measured levels of glucose in rats
[]{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_57 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 57"
role="doc-pagebreak"}learning to navigate mazes and found that the
energy reserves in their hippocampi alone were depleted by as much as 30
per cent. This energy drain was worse when the task became harder and
when the rats were older rats rather than young rats.

Learning is hard work and we are inherently energy conscious; you don't
want to use up precious resources in making changes in your brain unless
you have to. So you've really got to be motivated to want to learn
something new, either consciously or unconsciously, because otherwise
you might waste resources that could be put to better use elsewhere.

## [Types of learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_04_CHAP_C04_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h2_006 .head-a}

Now you've considered some of the biological basis of learning you might
find it helpful to also consider what types of learning you might be
doing or what types of learning you're expecting of your learners.
Sometimes you might come across ideas from neuroscience that can seem
contradictory but if you know what sort of learning you're expecting it
may help you assess which ideas will work better in your situation.

As you've seen, learning is a complex task and there have been numerous
theories and masses of research about learning over the years, all of
which continue to be debated and new ideas regularly supersede old ones.

Early psychological theories of behaviourism gave us some helpful models
of learning that are still useful but couldn't explain everything, and
then towards the end of the 20th century cognitive psychology appeared
to come to help explain some anomalies that behaviourism couldn't
handle, particularly around motivation. Cognitive psychology takes an
approach that is more related to information processing and acknowledges
the importance of mental states rather than just focusing on behaviour.

More recently, the study of brain biology has added extra data about the
physical changes to our brains as we learn; some of this is classed as
neuroeducation. This approach, of which you've covered some principles
already, focuses on how neurons link, how you create neuronal networks
and pathways and create long-term changes in your brain.

As mentioned before, most biological studies on learning are done
looking at animals, people with damaged brains or how children and young
people learn and there is far less research done on the biology of
normal adult learning. However, with the increasingly ageing population
there's now a lot more work on older brains and memory which of course
links []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_58 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 58"
role="doc-pagebreak"}back to learning. Unfortunately, there is still a
significant gap as to how learning happens in the world of work, which
is where our interests lie, so mainly we have to extrapolate from other
research as to what might be going on for adults learning at work.

As a rule behavioural psychologists divide learning into two basic
types: associative and non-associative learning.

### Non-associative learning {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_008 .head-b}

Non-associative learning is when a stimulus becomes associated with a
particular response. It's usually unconscious and we may not generally
pay attention to it in workplace learning. But, you can be sure
non-associative learning will be happening.

Non-associative learning is further divided into habituation and
sensitization.

*Habituation* is when you learn to get used to something; when the
stimulus fails to evoke its natural response any more. For instance, if
you show a stuffed owl to a songbird it will normally go into defensive
mode but if the stuffed owl is left there long enough and nothing bad
happens the songbird gets used to it and goes about its normal business.
You will have experienced this for yourself. Like at first you found
working in an open plan office distracting because of the phone calls or
people walking past, but now you don't notice them because you've become
habituated to it. This doesn't feel like learning but it is. The
question to ask yourself as a trainer is, are there things that you've
habituated your learners to that are aiding or distracting from their
learning? The reticular activating system quickly stops paying attention
to anything that isn't new or novel so the amazing set of inspiring
quotes you've had painted on your training room walls soon has no more
impact than the dull magnolia paint you had before.

*Sensitization* is when the stimulus creates an amplified response.
Neuronal connections are set up so that they fire again and again and
start to drag in other pathways like the attentional system. I remember
a trainer I worked with who, in attempting not to alienate any of his
audience, managed to completely distract me from the subject. He almost
always used the phrase 'does that make sense?' rather than 'do you see
what I mean?', 'how does that sound?' or other checking questions. The
first few times I heard him say 'does that make sense?' I thought it
seemed rather clever and thought I might use it myself. However, after
working with him for a few days I became sensitized to it and every time
he said it I became tense and annoyed. []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_59
.pagebreak aria-label="Page 59" role="doc-pagebreak"}'Why, oh why
doesn't he change his phrase?' I'd think and the more annoying it became
the more I listened out for it and so my response was amplified. We all
have our own tics, habits and pet phrases that may cause sensitization
in our learners and distract them from their learning. Or you can become
sensitized to something learners do unwittingly and may overreact, such
as the 100th time you hear 'But my boss sent me'.

### Associative learning -- classical and operant conditioning {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_009 .head-b}

The most famous example of learning through classical conditioning is
that of Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist, who took the natural
response of dogs to a stimulus, i.e. to salivate when they ate, and
taught them to have the same response when they heard a completely
unrelated stimulus -- a bell. Eventually the dogs salivated when they
heard the bell as readily as when they ate. This type of learning
happens all the time without us necessarily being consciously aware of
it but it can be used to consciously help people learn if there's
already a stimulus/response pathway in place that can be moulded.

Phobias are a good example of classical conditioning -- often we fear
things because there was once a stimulus paired with an unpleasant
experience. If you're seriously afraid of spiders the chances are that
as a child you spent time with an adult with a strong fear of spiders.
As a child you came to associate that person's fear, which as a child is
a scary experience in itself, with the stimulus of the spider. Phobias
such as fear of public speaking (apparently significant numbers of
people fear it more than death) can be cured by classical conditioning
too. People are taken through a series of experiences where they learn
to relax in presentation situations until they present confidently. You
can teach people to create useful associations so that when they
encounter a frequently occurring stimulus they automatically think of
the new learning. On one of our 'Train the Trainer' programmes we teach
people to associate chocolate with brain function so that every time
they see chocolate they start thinking about what's going on in people's
brains.

Operant conditioning is another form of associative learning, first
described by B F Skinner (1963) -- it's sometimes called Skinnerian
conditioning. Skinner proposed that learning happens as a result of
reward or punishment for particular behaviours; there is a consequence
of behaving in a particular way that reinforces or decreases that
behaviour. Gamification []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_60 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 60" role="doc-pagebreak"}uses many of the attributes of
operant conditioning such as using rewards to change your behaviour in
the game.

### Cognitive psychology, information processing and motivation to learn {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_010 .head-b}

Cognitive psychology came about when we began to look at learning as
information processing. It's no coincidence that it arose at a similar
time to the growing interest in computers and information technology.

Cognitive psychology also looks at our motivations for learning rather
than it being a pure stimulus response procedure. Much of what we learn
at work is delivered as information; even when we're learning about
skills there's often a significant theoretical component to learn, such
as models of leadership. While you can learn to communicate effectively
by observing and practising communication skills, almost all training
programmes at work require us to learn some new fact, name, model or
concept.

There are other skills you learn at work like how to use the latest IT
system, how to program a computer, how to use the coffee machine. These
all require us to learn new information, transform it from short-term to
long-term memory and then hang on to and more importantly use and apply
the information for as long as we need it. The majority of skills
learning happens in the workplace and often isn't even seen as learning
but simply 'doing the job'. It's sometimes only when we reflect that we
realize we've learnt to do something new.

### Learned helplessness {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_011 .head-b}

Another type of learning that can explain some types of behaviour is
learnt helplessness. Researchers discovered that animals that felt
powerless to escape from electric shocks eventually learnt just to stand
and receive them even when they could actually escape to a non-shock
area. They had learnt to be helpless.

This is a terrible thing to do to your learners but I think it happens
regularly in the real world. You get sent on a course, don't know why
you've gone, nobody is interested when you come back and you then get
asked just to get on with the job. At first you try, you show interest
and want to implement the new techniques you've learnt but you don't get
the chance. Then it happens again and you question whether it's the
right course for you but you get sent anyway and still nobody takes any
notice of your new ideas. Eventually, as you go through the third change
process in your organization []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_61 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 61" role="doc-pagebreak"}you learn not to ask questions
or show any initiative but just to do what they tell you, attend the
course and come back to work. As a trainer this is your worst nightmare
-- the people who say 'I was sent' when you ask why they are at your
workshop. This is effectively learnt helplessness. Effective Learning
and Development teams do their best to make sure they're not instilling
learnt helplessness in their participants.

### Forgetting is as important as learning {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_012 .head-b}

As part of your normal process of learning you also need to forget; we
become overwhelmed if we learn and remember everything. There was a case
described by A Luria in his book *The Mind of a Mnemonist: A little book
about a vast memory* (1987) of a patient who couldn't forget what he'd
learnt which meant that he struggled with simple tasks like reading a
passage because he couldn't filter out what was important. Information
swamped him. It seems that the process of learning and forgetting may be
a complex balance between two proteins in the brain: adducin, which
stimulates the growth of synaptic connections, and the musashi protein,
which inhibits the stabilization of connections. In our current world
where the pace of change seems to accelerate constantly, we need to
learn and relearn far faster than was required in the past. Possibly we
need to retain less 'knowledge' but need to learn more agile learning
skills so we can adapt rapidly.

### New ideas on learning {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_013 .head-b}

More recently, cognitive psychology is being challenged with concepts
like embodied cognition. Cognitive psychology places the emphasis on
what happens in your brain whereas embodied cognition is beginning to
look at the connections between the brain and the body when you're
learning and there are some fascinating studies on how our bodies might
have effects on our brains that we had never considered.

In his book *How People Learn* (2019), Nick Shackleton-Jones proposes we
learn by storing only our reactions to events, and we replay them when
we remember. We already know from many studies, such as those of
Elizabeth Loftus, that memory is constructed afresh each time we
remember rather than stored as a complete memory (more on memory later).

Shackleton-Jones suggests we store all memories as emotional context and
when we want to recall the memory we construct it by activating the
[]{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_62 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 62"
role="doc-pagebreak"}same neurological regions involved in the original
perception. He uses some excellent sources, such as Antonio Demasio and
Jaak Panksepp, who both proposed that animals don't store semantic
memories but store their 'reactions' to events and it\'s unlikely human
memory has evolved in an entirely different way. But while the theory
explains some anomalies in memory research, even Shackleton-Jones admits
there is insufficient empirical research or data to confirm his theory.
Just because it sounds scientific doesn't make it valid.

Shackleton-Jones suggests that all memories for events, facts, even
words, have an unconscious emotional context for us that is stored and
that when we want to recall the memory we construct it by activating the
same neurological regions involved in the original perception. He has
used some excellent sources, such as Antonio Demasio and Jaak Panksepp,
who both proposed that animals don't store semantic memories but store
their 'reactions' to events and it's unlikely that human memory has
evolved in an entirely different way. But while the theory explains some
anomalies in memory research, even Shackleton-Jones admits there is
currently insufficient empirical research or data to confirm the
validity of the theory.

As practitioners what we're really interested in is finding practical
applications of all this theory to the real world of learning design,
training, teaching, coaching and facilitating learning. Neuroscience has
not got to the stage yet where it can say that any particular type of
training/learning/coaching/facilitating is definitively the right way so
it's often a case of continuing to do what works but taking into account
what the research is suggesting.

Things that seem to be considered genuinely useful both from the
neuroscience and the practice of learning are:

- repetition

- spaced learning

- smaller group learning

- reward

- emotional and physical state.

You'll possibly not be particularly surprised by any of them because
good training has always included these ideas but at least we're now
getting evidence to base our good practice on. You'll come across all of
these through the rest of the book.

### Brain Friendly Learning -- a practical model {#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml__04_CHAP_C04_h3_014 .head-b}

Whatever theories you subscribe to about learning it's clear that it's
an iterative process of change happening in the brain and body that
affects behaviour and thus performance. As learning professionals we
need to educate []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_63 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 63" role="doc-pagebreak"}our colleagues and sponsors
that learning is more complex, and more interesting, than information
delivery.

There are multiple models of learning and I'm going to introduce you to
the GEAR model; an evidence-based model we've tried, tested and adapted
over many years of practical experience to create effective learning
journeys. Let's go through the GEAR model in overview and as you read
the rest of the book you'll see the evidence behind it and how it's
applied.

Like all models there isn't always a direct correlation to specific
biological models but it is an evidence-based framework to work from in
designing learning experiences or even going on your own learning
journey.

</figure>

At the heart of our model is the **brain** and every element of the
model includes what we know about the neuroscience that underpins
learning.

Learning is iterative. It's almost never finished. So when you work with
the GEAR model you learn in **modules** which enable you to build
learning gradually and naturally with the brain's natural processes.

The goal of effective learning and the GEAR model is **transfer;** new
information, behaviour and skills are applied and transferred into the
relevant context until you have built new neural pathways to master
knowledge, routines and habits. Successful transfer is affected by
multiple factors before, during and after any learning journey. The ones
with most impact in the workplace tend to fall into three main areas:

- []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_64 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 64"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}motivation of the learner

- design and delivery of the learning/training

- support from the organization.

Ina Weinbaeur Heidel has done extensive research and describes 12 levers
of transfer effectiveness in her excellent book, *What Makes Training
Really Work* (reproduced and adapted here with her permission).

1.  Transfer motivation -- do learners have a strong desire to put into
    practice what they have learnt?

2.  Self-efficacy -- do learners believe in their ability to apply and
    master the skills acquired?

3.  Transfer volition -- are learners ready and able to work
    consistently on implementing transfer plans?

4.  Clarity of expectations -- do learners already know the intended
    outcome before they start learning?

5.  Content relevance -- is the content close to real life and
    day-to-day work?

6.  Active practice -- do learners experience and try out the desired
    actions as realistically as possible in a safe environment?

7.  Transfer planning -- do learners make action plans with specific
    concrete activities during the training?

8.  Opportunities for application -- do people have the opportunity to
    implement what they learnt in their day-to-day work?

9.  Personal transfer capacity -- do learners have enough time and
    capacity in day-to-day work to implement what they have learnt?

10. Support from supervisors -- does someone relevant support, encourage
    and monitor people to apply what they learn?

11. Support from peers -- do colleagues welcome and support the transfer
    of what's been learnt?

12. Is transfer noticeable and is it having the desired results?

The fuel for learning is **motivation** but it doesn't remain constant
during a learning journey; it changes and goes up and down regularly,
partly because of the energy requirements to rewire all those neural
networks. Whether you're a learner or a learning professional you need
to support the appropriate physical and mental state at all stages of
learning. (Read much more about motivation in [Chapter
5](#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml).)

#### []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_65 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 65" role="doc-pagebreak"}Guide {.head-c}

When you go to a new city a good guide will show you the highlights so
you don't feel overwhelmed and will stop you wasting time in boring or
dangerous areas. And you've always got a reference to return to and
explore further. Learning is similar. You need to be aware of what's
possible and available. This is the awareness building, information and
content acquisition part of learning and will keep your senses on high
alert.

It's easier to learn when you reduce cognitive overload by breaking
things down into bite-size chunks -- finding relevant information and
experiences at the right time and in the right quantities. You may hear
this referred to as scaffolded learning. Read more about motivation,
curiosity, senses, attention and memory in subsequent chapters.

#### Experiment {.head-c}

Once you've got information inside your head you can experiment and test
how it links to or challenges your current practice, experience or world
view. You need consciously to practise using new information or new
skills in a safe environment and reflect on success, failure and
feedforward. Find out more about creating meaning and using different
intelligences for connecting information and experience to real life in
[Chapter 8](#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml). Sometimes people suggest starting at
this stage rather than Guide, but that can be a problem if the learner
has no domain knowledge. They waste motivation, time and effort and get
things wrong because they lack the information to identify critical
differences.

#### Apply {.head-c}

One of the biggest challenges of learning is going from theory to
practice. It seems only about 15 per cent of people actively transfer
learning back into the workplace (Brinkerhoff, 2006) which means there's
little impact on performance or return on investment. We need to make it
easier for people to connect learning and work and one way to do this is
initiate Work Based Actions, connecting learners to people who can offer
specific opportunities to apply new learning and who support and
validate progress. Discover more about testing, habits and practice in
[Chapter 10](#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml).

#### Retain {.head-c}

Brains are built to forget or else we'd be completely overwhelmed with
the bombardment of sensory information we receive every day. If an
experience isn't tagged as 'important' for the future then we tend to
forget it. So how []{#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml_page_66 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 66" role="doc-pagebreak"}can we make learning memorable
and ensure that people remember, retain and can recall information and
experiences so they can build and master new techniques, skills and
habits? Spaced repetition and spaced practice are both vital ingredients
if you want to see a return on investment of your time, energy and money
in learning. Read on to find out about the value of reviewing,
reflecting, stories and sleep on sticky memories.

If you've read previous versions of this book you will remember I used
Colin Rose's accelerated learning MASTER model (1998) but it had some
flaws, not the least of which was that the name 'accelerated learning'
implied learning might be faster. However, I owe a huge debt of
gratitude to the MASTER model because it forms a solid foundation for
the GEAR model. I believe the GEAR model is better adapted for an
increasingly blended and digital approach to learning.

Whatever model of learning you've worked with it's an interesting
exercise to map it onto the GEAR model to see how they relate and where
you can continue to improve your own practice.

What you need to remember from this chapter:

- Learning takes place at a cellular level and uses up resources,
  neurotransmitters and glucose in connecting neurons and building
  neural networks.

- Learning is not the same as delivering content -- it's a process that
  takes place over time, in people's heads and bodies.

- There are different types of learning and when you're designing,
  training, teaching or getting other people to work or behave
  differently it pays to be aware of what sort of change you're looking
  for.

- Use the GEAR model as a process to design and deliver effective
  training -- tie it into the neuroscience for a rigorous look at
  learning.

## ['When you're smiling...'](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_05_CHAP_C05_h2_001){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h2_001 .head-a}

Did you know that smiling really changes what's going on in your brain?
When I was studying psychology back in the 1980s one of my favourite
hypotheses was one from William James in the 19th century that suggested
that you didn't smile because you were happy, but when you smiled you
felt happy. He suggested it may be true of all physical manifestations
of emotions -- that they were the cause of the emotion as much as the
result. If that was so, then surely it becomes quite easy to feel happy
because all you have to do is smile? While clearly our emotions are
complex and multifaceted, neuroscience has caught up with William James
and seems to show he had a point.

You may have already heard that if you put a pen between your teeth to
mimic the effect of a smile you'll rate cartoons as funnier than if you
don't have a pen between your teeth. However, this turns out to be a
myth and it's only genuine smiles that have an effect.

People who are smiling see other people's frowns as less severe and when
they're frowning they see other people's smiles as less happy. A recent
study at City University London took EEG measurements in parts of the
brain that recognize faces, like the angular gyrus, associative visual
cortex and the somatosensory cortex, which are particularly active when
those faces are emotional rather than neutral. They found that the EEG
response was strengthened when people wearing a neutral expression
looked at smiling faces. When people who were smiling looked at smiling
and neutral faces their activity was increased. The scientists suggested
that when you smile, your brain, at least partially, interprets someone
else's neutral face as smiling []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_69 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 69" role="doc-pagebreak"}as well. So perhaps this is
the neurological evidence for the old song 'When you're smiling the
whole world smiles with you!'

## [Motivated learners](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_05_CHAP_C05_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h2_002 .head-a}

What gets you out of bed in the morning? What is happening in your brain
that drives enough motivation to give you the energy to overcome the
inertia of lying in bed and to physically stand up, go and put the
kettle on, shower, have breakfast, shave or put your makeup on, get
dressed, walk the dog, walk to the end of the road, get on the bus or
train, drive 40 miles, go into the office or factory and brightly say,
'Good morning, everyone,' before spending a day doing some kind of work?

You're going to notice a theme in this book which is that learning
happens in learners' heads and not in the trainer's head, though of
course most great teachers say they learn as much from their pupils as
their pupils learn from them. If you're truly helping others to learn it
seems it's almost impossible not to learn something yourself.

People can learn things when they are demotivated but it's less likely
to happen and they are more inclined to learn the stuff that you're not
particularly interested in them learning, like how to disrupt a room or
how to download a new app to their phone. People who are motivated to
learn are going to learn faster, more effectively and for the longer
term than those who have merely shown up. But, as you've already seen,
learning isn't a 'once and it's done' activity and effective learning
takes many different forms and needs a variety of different mind states.

This chapter will focus on what's happening in people's brains when they
are in different states that help them learn. More practically, you'll
think about how you can help people get into that state -- what you as a
designer or facilitator of learning can do to maximize the chance that
people will be at maximum receptivity for the wonderful information,
ideas, attitude changes or skills that you plan to share with them and
that they can turn into new habits, behaviours or thoughts (see [Figure
5.1](#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_Figure_5_1) for a visual guide to
the chapter).

You'll explore some more about *curiosity* in this chapter -- you had a
taster in [Chapter 1](#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml). You'll find out how to make
people *feel alert* and *pay attention* in a more detailed look at
attention in [Chapter 7](#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml). Perhaps you might find
some of your ideas *challenged*, which is a useful learning state in
itself. You'll uncover some ways to create that feeling of slight
concern, []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_70 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 70"
role="doc-pagebreak"}without overwhelming people with enormous *stress*
which is less helpful as a learning state.

To balance all that curiosity and challenge you may have learners who
need to be less on alert; they may need to decrease some of their stress
responses and you'll consider what you can do to *make people feel more
relaxed*.

What happens when people want to *reflect*? They need to do that to
learn and you'll start the journey into reflection when you read
[Chapter 11](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml). In this chapter you'll hear about some
ways to create *exploratory*, *playful* and *experimental* states which
will be covered in more depth in [Chapter 12](#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml).

There's something about *persistence* that's vital for learning so let's
see what happens in people's heads when they are being persistent and
how you can help them to persist at activities to help them learn.

At no stage would you expect people to be in all these states at once
but over the course of a learning session it might be useful for them to
experience many of them.

This is not a chapter on motivation per se but a chapter on how to
motivate people and their brains to learn; in the process you're sure to
read some things you've heard before. If it's all familiar then skip on
to the next chapter that is motivating for you. If it's new or there are
new elements that you've not thought of before then pay attention to
what's keeping you reading.

## [Brain states](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_05_CHAP_C05_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h2_003 .head-a}

Let's explore some different states your brain can be in that help you
learn and how to stimulate those states.

### Curiosity killed the cat {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h3_001 .head-b}

Why is curiosity such a great thing for learning? Clearly if it did kill
the cat then it isn't a very useful state because death tends to curb
the learning process but perhaps that particular old wives' tale also
goes with the one about cats having nine lives. Cats and people are
curious and when you help people become curious about something they
will seek out answers for themselves. Those answers are going to stick
with them longer than any answer you hand them on a plate. Let's explore
why.

#### What happens in your brain when you're curious? {.head-c}

Researchers at California Institute of Technology used fMRI scanning to
see that curiosity seems to activate the caudate, a part of the brain
associated with anticipated reward (Kang et al, 2009). People were
prepared to spend their own experimental resources to find out answers
when they were more curious about the information and were more likely
to remember the answer to a question they were curious about than one
they weren't.

Curiosity increases with uncertainty (up to a point), suggesting that a
small amount of knowledge can pique curiosity and prime our hunger for
knowledge in the same way that the smell or look of food can cause us to
feel hungry even if we weren't before. The dopamine that is released as
you seek the answer is of course rewarding.

So if people feel rewarded when they are curious and remember things
better it seems a good idea to increase curiosity levels. So what can
you do?

#### Agatha Christie and dopamine levels {.head-c}

If the number of murder mystery series and detective novels is anything
to go by then people really enjoy a sense of mystery or suspense. You
probably already know that stories are great for learners but sometimes
it's very easy to tell a story chronologically and go from beginning to
end.

Agatha Christie was a British author renowned for her mystery stories.
You may be a fan of Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot on TV or film and you
may have even read her books, which keep you guessing right up to the
end []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_71 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 71"
role="doc-pagebreak"}as to who did the murder and it's almost impossible
to guess who it was. Have you ever thought about how she wrote them?

Instead of plotting out her story and knowing from the beginning who the
murderer was, she would write the story without even knowing herself.
She wrote so that anyone could have done the murder and, just like her
own detectives, she didn't know until the last chapter who the murderer
was going to be. Once she'd written everything but the last chapter
she'd decide who'd done the deadly deed and then write that final
chapter. Sometimes she'd have to go back and rework a few areas, but on
the whole she'd leave the original chapters as they were. This may be
one of the reasons her books and the programmes are so addictive; that
dopamine is floating around in your head as you keep wondering.

In a real-life mystery, some research reported on the BBC and in *The
Times* suggested a study had been done to measure neurotransmitter
levels as people read Agatha Christie but no reliable published data is
available to explain where these reports came from. I told you earlier
on that sometimes you have to be sceptical about what you read even when
it appears to prove your lovely theory. As it stands, it appears nobody
knows whether Agatha Christie's mysteries do actually raise
neurotransmitter levels, but they clearly motivate many people to keep
reading.

[]{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_72 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 72"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Robert Cialdini, one of the world's experts on
influence, has also studied the power of mystery in presenting
information to people. If you read his books or are lucky enough to sit
in his classes he invariably tells you something curious and then asks
you to think about what would make people act in that way. Once that
question is in your head and you're hooked, he can start to unravel the
events leading up to the mystery.

#### What you can do to increase curiosity in your learners {.head-c}

Send something to engage people in the days/weeks prior to a more formal
learning event, whether that's a face-to-face session or a digital
experience, such as: a themed invitation; articles/reading to review;
short online questionnaires; puzzles/quizzes linked to the learning
content; videos are usually a hit -- the possibilities are endless!

1.  Send curiosity-inducing prework -- a colleague of mine once sent his
    participants joining information that included a £10 note and an
    instruction to go and buy a cushion of their choice. As you may
    imagine, people arrived feeling very curious.

2.  Send small 'taster' amounts of information to stimulate curiosity.

3.  []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_73 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 73"
    role="doc-pagebreak"}Asking questions sets off a set of neuronal
    connections and interconnections as your brain attempts to find
    answers, so ask questions to stimulate thinking and get people
    curious about what they want to learn.

4.  Remember we talked about guessing in [Chapter 1](#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml)
    -- ask people to guess the answers to your questions, even if they
    don't think they know.

5.  Use questionnaires to motivate people to find out more about a topic
    or to find out more about themselves.

#### Raising curiosity levels through the roof -- but look out for the backfire {.head-c}

Paul Wright, a great trainer friend who sadly died a few years ago, ran
an exercise to show how you could use music when learning communication
skills. He wanted us to experiment so decided not to tell us what the
outcome of the exercise was but asked us to take turns communicating
using simple percussion instruments. I was curious so I happily
participated and trusted that it would all become clear in the end.
Unfortunately for Paul his great idea to raise curiosity and
experimentation backfired with Helen who partnered me. She wasn't
curious and wanting to experiment but instead was stuck and frustrated
because she couldn't see the point of what we were doing. She was
increasing her stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol and that
interfered with her learning because she just couldn't let it go and
explore. Eventually, Paul had to tell her what the purpose was.

The point of this story is to illustrate how it's impossible to guess
what might go on in a learner's head. All you can do is create the
conditions that might work and then watch out for what does result. If
you find you've created a state you hadn't anticipated then you may have
to counterbalance it or think about how to change the state.

### Attention and relaxation {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h3_002 .head-b}

#### Relaxing learners and reducing fear {.head-c}

When our brains are operating at high alert we are prepared for fight,
flight, freeze and flock but our frontal cortices are not ready for
rational thinking and information processing. There is an intricate
balance between sufficient and insufficient stress, which is sometimes
called eustress, and you'll find out more about that in [Chapter
7](#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml) on attention. Here, you'll focus on what you can
do to reduce unhelpful stress, and in [Chapter 7](#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml)
you'll consider more about what keeps people at a helpful state of
alertness to provoke learning.

[]{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_74 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 74"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Many people find training makes them nervous,
bringing back unpleasant memories of school or other poor training
experiences. Any of us can start some training feeling stressed or
overwhelmed potentially because of events completely unrelated to the
training. You need to help these people to reduce any high levels of
cortisol and adrenaline and prevent their emotional network, and
particularly the amygdala, from dominating over the frontal cortex.

Some of the simple things that you can do get lost in the pressure of
delivering content so here are some ideas to bear in mind before you
consider content.

#### Connect people {.head-c}

Social isolation has been shown to have the same effects on our brain as
physical pain and can cause it to release its own opiates: endorphins.
Research in mice also indicates that social isolation may reduce brain
myelination, which is vital to brain plasticity and therefore learning.
(You'll find more about myelination in [Chapter 11](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml)
about reflecting and reviewing.)

**If you wouldn't hit a participant to cause physical pain, why would
you let them feel socially isolated?**

You can reduce social isolation by connecting with people yourself
before, during and after they start learning. You can do this in really
simple ways like sending personalized invitations to training events,
including photos of the trainers or the other people who've
participated. Take a leaf out of marketing's book and create a 'learning
lifestyle' that people will want to emulate -- friends they'll want to
be with when they start some training, even if it's a webinar or digital
learning. Make people feel this is the 'place' to be. Think how well
apps include 'social' tools such as 'like', 'share' or 'forward' to
increase social engagement.

Use social media as part of your strategy for connecting people and
increasing their opportunities to learn. You'll probably have to work
within the confines of organizational policies but, where you can use
it, social media is an effective way of helping people to connect
before, during and after a learning event.

In the first edition of this book in 2016, Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs) were probably the fastest growing social way of learning,
especially in the further education sector. The Open University invested
hugely in this social learning phenomenon and in June 2015 became the
record-holder for the biggest single run of an online course (Stansbury,
2015); more []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_75 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 75" role="doc-pagebreak"}than 400,000 learners enrolled
from over 150 countries on one of its English Language courses. MOOCs
are online courses with unlimited participation and open access via the
web and are still evolving as learning, education and business models
change. A report from 2018 (Shah, 2018) suggests they will continue to
be an important part of the family of digital learning. They are known
for generating enormous numbers at enrolment, though completion rates
are still notoriously much poorer than other educational tools, which
helps to make the point that motivation needs to be maintained
throughout a learning journey -- it's not good enough just at the start.

#### Reduce the possibility of obvious stressors {.head-c}

Think about what it's like when you're attending a meeting or a training
course and you're lost, late and didn't really want to be there in the
first place. Suddenly, your sense of direction goes, you can't remember
the name of the venue and you start to panic. But what if you had a
picture of the venue on the piece of paper clutched in your hand or on
your mobile as well as just an address? And I don't mean the sort of
picture the hotel will send out looking glitzy and glamorous. I mean a
photo taken from the street showing the roadworks and the dingy building
next door; one that looks exactly like what people will see as they walk
up to the building or drive past it.

You'll hear more about language later but for now think about the
language that will help reduce stress or frustration. There's a sales
technique called 'feel, felt, found' which can be useful to consider
when thinking about this. For example, 'I appreciate you *feel*
frustrated about attending this health and safety training when you've
already covered some of the content before. Other people with your level
of experience have also *felt* the same way. However, what they've
*found* on the day is their knowledge really helped newer people in the
organization, and of course legislation (*or something*) has moved on,
so they did learn new stuff too.'

Some organizations take this very seriously and train everyone involved
in learning how to reduce stress and increase motivation. This is about
creating a culture of learning that goes beyond trainers or learning
designers and extends out to the wider team. If you've designed a
fantastic piece of e-learning or a marvellous classroom session and the
person sending out the information isn't part of the learning culture
they can inadvertently undermine all your hard work with an
inappropriate comment or lack of care. It's like having a great
salesperson who encourages you to buy a product but the person at the
cash till makes you wait for ages while they finish a
[]{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_76 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 76"
role="doc-pagebreak"}conversation with a colleague. I'm sure you've
occasionally walked out of shops without the desired item because of a
non-attentive shop assistant; that's not what you want in a learning
culture. Take the time to make the receptionist, the administration
team, leaders, supervisors and managers part of your learning culture.

**What else makes people feel comfortable and reduces stress and social
isolation?**

Here's a quick checklist of things you can do as people arrive at a
training activity to help reduce their stress levels.

Gather this information through observation, active listening, or simply
asking a question (the chat function can be very useful):

- Are people in the right place?

- What is their name and how is it pronounced?

- Do they know where the toilets are?

- Do they have refreshments?

- Have they had a stressful journey or previous meeting so they need
  time to calm down?

- Are they hot, cold, a smoker? You'll need to know how to change the
  room temperature and what the smoking arrangements are.

- Non-confidential personal and workplace details -- which you can refer
  to as appropriate during the session.

- Where they're from --there may be time or travel implications.

- What section/office/organization, etc. they work in.

- Technology issues or fear of technology.

- Voluntary or required attendance -- particularly important if there's
  anyone who has been 'sent'.

- Sensory, mobility or learning disability which you haven't been made
  aware of.

- Any other access requirements.

- Particular concerns about the training, e.g. giving a presentation to
  a group.

- Potential dietary, medical or diversity needs, e.g. to eat, take
  medication or pray at regular times.

- Individual []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_77 .pagebreak
  aria-label="Page 77" role="doc-pagebreak"}experience, knowledge or
  skills which may contribute to others' learning.

All these ideas can be adapted to online, virtual learning too. In the
*Webinars Pocketbook* Andy Lancaster and I adapt numerous ideas to a
virtual learning environment (Collins and Lancaster, 2015).

### Persistence {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h3_003 .head-b}

One of the big requirements for motivation is persistence. If someone is
to learn something they need to persist at it and there are all sorts of
ideas about how long you need to persist at something in order to learn
it. You'll come across the 10,000 hours myth in [Chapter
10](#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml) on testing and practice.

What keeps you persisting at something though? What is it that will keep
'gamers' glued to their computers for hours on end, gamblers sitting at
machines or students poring over books? It seems a common factor is
dopamine, which is considered vitally important for motivation. It's not
the only neurotransmitter involved though and it's not as simple as a
pure stimulus--response mechanism. It seems we are all affected by
dopamine but it can be where and how it has its effect that might
determine whether you persist at a task or choose to give up at a lower
level of achievement.

Dopamine is usually associated with reward but it may be it has its most
important effect before you actually get a reward; it encourages you to
achieve a goal or to avoid something you don't like depending on where
it's acting in your brain.

One study mapped the brains of 'go-getters' and 'slackers' and found
increased levels of dopamine in both types of people. For the slackers,
it was in the anterior insula -- a part of the brain implicated in
emotion and risk perception. The go-getters had higher dopamine levels
in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, both of which are involved in
goal-directed motivation. It may be that dopamine helps you with the
cost--benefit analysis of a task rather than providing an actual reward
itself.

One way to help you persist and increase the 'go-getter' type behaviour
may be to set incremental goals, according to neurologist Judy Willis.
By training yourself to feel rewarded at the end of a task, you rewire
the brain to produce dopamine and therefore give yourself positive
feedback as you meet the challenges and complete the series of goals
you've set yourself.

#### []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_78 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 78" role="doc-pagebreak"}Goal orientation: Extrinsic or intrinsic motivation {.head-c}

Carol Dweck (1986), a leading researcher on the science of motivation,
suggests we have two sorts of goal orientation that may be important in
learning: *goal-directed motivation*, which is about performance and may
be more of an extrinsic motivator, and *learning orientation*, which is
intrinsic and which ties into our motivations for mastery of a skill or
topic.

**Should you incentivize learners or let them find their own
motivation?**

There is now a huge amount of evidence to show that on the whole, with
tasks that are cognitively interesting (which learning ought to be)
people are more motivated by intrinsic than extrinsic motivation. They
are more inclined to persist at a task they are self-motivated to do
than at one where there are external rewards for performance or goals
are externally created. If you're interested to explore this in more
detail then I'd recommend Daniel Pink's book *Drive* (2011) as a good
starting point.

There is some evidence that schools are now considering increasing the
level of learning goal orientation in preference to performance
orientation but it's not universally adopted, and is it happening within
organizations and businesses? We still persist with children and adults
with providing rewards for when they've learnt: 'If you do your
revision, you can watch television'; 'If you pass your exams, I'll pay
for a holiday'; 'If you go on this course, you'll get a promotion'.

Instead of looking at what people can get if they do the learning, we
need to look at what will encourage people to engage in the learning for
its own merit. Gaming culture is taking this concept forward by studying
what keeps people persisting at tasks looking at it from the different
viewpoints of cognition, design, motivation and rewards and also the
technology. You'll briefly explore some of the ideas from gaming in
[Chapter 15](#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml) on the future of learning.

One of the features of learning orientation is an increase in the
requirement to experiment, test and be open to making mistakes -- the
stuff of creativity.

### Exploratory and playful states -- creative states {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h3_004 .head-b}

What part of your brain is it that helps you to be creative? You'll
perhaps not be surprised to hear that there isn't one part that's
identified as 'the creative part'; it's a complex network that enables
you to have new thoughts and to consider wonderfully impossible things.

[]{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_79 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 79"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The right cortex is more associated with holistic
and intuitive processing, which may be linked to creativity. However,
the left side of your cortex also sorts and processes information so is
required in all aspects of creativity too. The idea of a right-brained,
creative person is a creative generalization derived from some genuine
science about the brain's tendency to process information differently in
each hemisphere and you've already considered how that myth may have
come about in [Chapter 3](#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml).

#### How can you help people be more playful and creative? {.head-c}

Breaking patterns is a great way to do this. Neurons are linked together
as networks and patterns become strengthened with regular use -- the
more often you have a particular train of thought the easier and more
automatic it becomes. This is incredibly useful when you need to do
something regularly; for instance, the neuronal pattern that links the
hole in the wall and the large wooden plank on hinges and allows you to
shut the door without having to work out exactly how to do it each time.
This tendency to create strong patterns is less helpful when you need to
be creative -- when you need to break out of the patterns of thinking
and create new ways of thinking.

There's no such thing as a paper jelly, but as soon as you think about
one your brain creates new patterns in your neuronal networks, new links
and new possibilities. Research suggests slower alpha brainwaves are
particularly dominant when you're feeling creative. You may remember
that the beta waves are most active when you're alert and thinking hard.

A study at The Royal College of Music using neurofeedback seemed to help
music students be more creative by stimulating theta waves and teaching
them to access those waves more deliberately; those are the slow waves
you get in light sleep and in dreaming.

In a training environment you're going to have trouble wiring people up
to machines to stimulate their brains with particular waves so instead
you've got to harness people's natural abilities to do this.

One way is to induce feelings of relaxation with a guided visualization
and this can be particularly effective if you do it in those parts of
the day, like after lunch, where people may be already inclined to feel
drowsy. Another study seemed to indicate that you can increase the
benefits of taking time out like this by drinking coffee just before
having a short 15-minute nap or relaxation exercise. Caffeine has been
shown to enhance cognitive performance and it takes about 15 minutes for
the caffeine to kick in. So you take 15 minutes to have a pleasant alpha
wave break, maybe even []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_80 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 80" role="doc-pagebreak"}drifting into a theta
brainwave break and then when you come out of that, ready to be alert,
the caffeine is ready to give you an extra brain boost too.

You can easily find video clips or recordings of music and visual
effects that will allegedly help you get into alpha and theta brain
states but you'll probably also know how to stimulate your most creative
thinking. You are also likely to find most other people will tell you
the same sort of things. In a workshop on creativity I ran regularly for
two years we found the most common answers to what makes you creative
were daydreaming, walking, showering, taking a bath, running and 'when
I'm not thinking about the problem'. Later in this book there are
numerous references to creative thinking where you'll come across some
more practical ideas.

If we go back to thinking about creative thinking being the opportunity
to create new pathways then it's important to keep the brain plastic by
regularly exposing yourself to new experiences, new places, new people
and new ideas. If you need learners to be more creative then expose them
to new things too.

**Nikki Ayles**, *Independent Capability Development Consultant*

Of Dendrites and Positivity

The power of positive emotions to broaden perception and scope of
attention has been explored by Barbara Fredrickson through her
'Broaden-and-Build theory' (2001). Barbara describes how 10 positive
emotions of joy, serenity, amusement, awe, pride, gratitude, interest,
inspiration, hope, and love are like tiny engines for growth. Just as a
waterlily expands its petals outwards to take in more rays from the sun
and grow, so positive emotions drive our brains to open, taking in a
broader variety of information, moving towards new possibilities, ideas
and alternative explanations. In one study supporting this theory,
brain-imaging researchers found that *only* when participants were in a
positive emotional state was neural activity present in parts of the
brain responsible for registering global components of a test picture
(Fredrickson, 2001). Positivity had literally given participants a wider
perceptual field of view.

This and similar findings hold exciting implications for the training
room. The more positivity learners feel, the more open their minds and
the more opportunities they should perceive for applying learnings to
their own situations/jobs -- a yardstick for measuring any training's
'stickiness'.

[]{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_81 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 81"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Even more thought-provoking is pairing the findings
of cognitive neuroscientist Mark Beeman with those of Ronald Friedman
and Jens Förster (2005) to take this idea further. Using EEG and fMRI
scans, Beeman and co. found that when solving problems using insight
(involving thinking broadly and openly rather than using narrow
analytical strategies) there was greater activation in the right
hemisphere (RH) of the brain than the left (LH). Beeman explains this
phenomenon has a neural basis: pyramidal neurons (brain cells) collect
information through their dendrites (branches). Dendrites in the right
side of the brain are more numerous, further from the cell body and make
more connections (synapses) with other neurons, than those in the left
hemisphere. The left hemisphere's shorter dendrites seem incredibly
adept at accessing and pulling in 'close-to-hand' information to solve
problems quickly. The activation is strong, but narrow. This has
evolutionary significance, since, if our ancestors were facing attack
from a sabre-toothed tiger, sitting around pontificating the many ways
to escape would be a sure-fire way to become the tiger's next meal!
Survival was dependent on our ability to access and focus on immediate
and dominant problem solutions. This strategy is less effective when
addressing problems that require us to look for the non-obvious. For
example, in order for learners to get to grips with application of new
concepts, they often need to abandon well-learnt and automatically
generated assumptions. This is where activation of the right hemisphere
is valuable. Beeman and co.'s research showed RH activation is weaker,
but critically also broader. RH dendrites have a larger input field,
'reaching out' further into the brain to access more remotely associated
information, locate alternative interpretations of stimuli and to make
more novel connections.

So then, if we as trainers could stimulate activation of learners' RH
neurons, this could be valuable in promoting openness to new ideas
presented, broader approaches to workshop exercises and self-generation
of more extensive applications for learnings. But how to do this?

We loop back to positivity. An intriguing study (the mouse maze
experiment) by Ronald Friedman and Jens Förster induced one group of
participants to feel negative emotions through anticipation of and focus
on a negative outcome to a situation (avoidance-related motivation);
another group was induced to expect and focus on a positive outcome
(approach-related motivation) and a third control group was placed into
a neutral state with little emotional arousal. After this 'priming', all
participants undertook tests requiring either creativity (greater RH
activation) or analytical problem-solving (greater LH activation). Those
in the positive outcome group performed better on creativity tasks,
generating more novel solutions than the negative outcome group. It
seems []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_82 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 82"
role="doc-pagebreak"}positivity stimulated higher relative activation of
RH brain regions and pathways, broadening and expanding the focus of
participants' attention in two ways: broader *internal conceptual
attention --* better targeting and activation of relatively remote
information and mental representations -- i.e. finding and using more of
the 'stuff' you've filed away in your brain and normally can't remember
-- and broader *external perceptual attention*, heightening responses to
a broader range of external environmental stimuli -- i.e. you notice
more!

These findings have a plethora of applications for trainers. Most
directly, I have put them into practice helping learners frame personal
learning outcomes. Having individuals craft these before attending
workshops is key to a brain-friendly approach. I also ask learners to
bring a current project/challenge to work on throughout. When learners
are able to frame desired outcomes for their challenge in positive terms
(e.g. *'I'd like to find ways to increase productivity of my team over
the next six months'* rather than '*I'd like to stop my team bickering
and slacking so much'*), and by visualizing 'what good will look like'
when their outcome is achieved, the positive emotions generated within
that individual (e.g. interest, pride and inspiration) tend to motivate
him/her towards broader thought patterns and eventually more numerous,
novel and effective solutions.

The broadening effect of positive emotions has more far-reaching
applications for capability development than just outcome framing.

*CHALLENGE*: *how many ways can you imagine in which stimulating
positive emotions -- hence promoting relatively higher right hemisphere
activation -- could be valuable for learners you work with?*

One thing that has been shown to increase motivation to learn is an
expectation that you will need to teach -- and if you're a trainer I'm
sure you've already experienced this. You're told you're going to have
to take over a new course or subject that you've not taught before and
you spend all weekend swotting up.

In a study of schoolchildren by John Nestojko (2014), pupils who learnt
a passage of information and thought they'd have to teach another group
remembered more of the information than those who had to learn it just
for themselves. This study required further investigation to see how
valid it would be in all circumstances; but that's the nature of
research. Once you start asking precise questions you need to drill down
deeper and deeper. []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_83 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 83" role="doc-pagebreak"}Suffice to say, most of us
know that the best way to learn something is to have to teach it.

Next time you've got a new programme to design perhaps you can reduce
your work and increase the learners' work. Curate the resources, give
them to your learners and ask them to teach the next group -- that will
motivate them to want to learn it and is much better for everyone than
you trying to stuff a lot of information into brains that aren't really
interested. And you keep your weekend free to relax.

## [Other influences on people's beliefs about learning -- negative and positive](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_05_CHAP_C05_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h2_005 .head-a}

People approach learning very differently and as a learning facilitator
some of these things are under your control and some are not. Think
about which of these ideas you may be able to have an impact on and what
you can do. There'll be some things out of your control but you can do
things to counteract or enhance them:

- parents and others who were present during people's formative years

- teachers and the education system

- peers -- what else does everyone around your learner think about
  learning?

- organizational culture -- particularly line managers

- previous training experiences

- perceived benefit to the person -- the WIIFM factor (what's in it for
  me?)

- expectations of what they'll have to do, e.g. role play/make a
  presentation, pass a test

- environment -- /lighting/heating/video and sound quality/external
  distraction, etc.

- technology issues or fear of technology

- financial implications, e.g. self-funding/promised pay rise/redundancy

- why they're there, i.e. voluntary or mandatory

- how they've been invited or 'sent'

- trainer knowledge/skills/attitude/how they welcome learners

- location or transport issues

- time differences

- []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_84 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 84"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}medical and physical conditions

- outside issues with employer/friends/family

- outstanding work in the office

- how they feel that day.

Here are some things you can control to increase motivation to learn
when you're working with people face-to-face or virtually:

- Make the initial environment as welcoming as possible to break down
  barriers.

- Pay regular attention to the environment.

- Apologize sincerely once for problems, then move on.

- Have backup plans if technology doesn't work.

- Use humour advisedly -- let it flow naturally from the group.

- Give people WIIFMs regularly.

- Listen fully to individuals -- even if you know you've heard it
  before, you haven't heard it from that person's perspective and they
  may not have been able to express it.

- Be congruent in your words and actions with the learning you are
  sharing.

- Value all contributions, even if you have to work with the meaning to
  make sense of what has been said!

- Be vigilant about body language -- manage yours and watch for messages
  of theirs. 'Digital' body language can tell you a lot about how
  engaged a virtual learner is.

- Don't criticize, argue, or put people on the spot.

- The meaning of communication is the response you get -- if your
  audience doesn't understand you or they do something 'wrong', it's
  usually down to you!

## [Motivating yourself](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_05_CHAP_C05_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h2_006 .head-a}

Before we move off the chapter of motivating learners it might just be
worth thinking about how you motivate yourself and the impact that has
on you and your audience.

At the beginning of this chapter you read a story about how we see other
people as smiling more when we're smiling ourselves. This is another of
[]{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_85 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 85"
role="doc-pagebreak"}those findings that shows your motivation matters
when you're training. There's also the slightly vexing question of
mirror neurons. When they were first discovered in the 1990s at Parma
University in Italy there was a lot of excitement that they might be the
neurons that allowed us to show empathy, among other things. When a
monkey saw someone else pick up food, particular neurons appeared to
respond as if the viewer had also picked up the food. fMRI scanning
studies went on to suggest that humans have significant networks of
mirror neurons, particularly in the sensory and motor cortex, that might
enable us to feel what it's like to move like someone else. The leap to
imply that we can empathize with others on an emotional level due to
these mirror neurons is one that's been hotly disputed and is probably
too much to conclude from the research.

However, most of us recognize that we are affected by other people's
moods and if you as the facilitator sound grumpy or bored with the
subject you're not going to be the greatest example to your learners.

Many performers have a routine they develop before going on stage that
helps them get into the 'zone' and this can be useful to you too. You
might choose to do breathing exercises or anchor a particular movement
or piece of music to your best mental state for working with people.
Once it's fully 'anchored' you will find it easier to attain that state.
And if all else fails, find something to smile about -- you'll soon
convince yourself that you feel on top of the world.

## [Summary](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_05_CHAP_C05_h2_007){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml__05_CHAP_C05_h2_007 .head-a}

You've covered a number of ideas in this chapter:

- Motivation is the first stage in the process of learning.

- There are different states, both emotional and cognitive, that help us
  learn more easily.

- Curiosity releases dopamine, which acts as a reward itself but is also
  implicated in goal-directed behaviour, in assessing risk and avoidance
  of unwanted behaviours.

- The right level of attention is needed to learn effectively and you
  can reduce stress in learners by meeting their physical and emotional
  needs, including connecting people socially.

- Exploration and playfulness increase creativity and brain plasticity
  and help people become open to new ideas as well as creating their
  own.

- []{#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml_page_86 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 86"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Persistence is a required state for learning --
  we need to practise, repeat and practise.

- As a trainer you can foster and create these states.

- There are lots of practical things you can do to make people feel more
  inclined to learn, reduce their fear and increase their motivation.

- Remember to stay motivated yourself.

What do you notice if you read or hear the name Derek?

Possibly it will bring back a memory of someone you know called Derek;
you might think of other words that sound like Derek, or names like
Eric. But, unless you are very unusual, you probably don't get a taste
of ear wax. However, James Wannerton, who runs a pub, has this very
unusual sensation quite often because one of his regulars is called
Derek and whenever he hears the name he experiences this odd, unrelated
taste.

He is one of an unusual group of people who experience something called
synaesthesia, where some of the senses appear to be blended. Other
people with the condition may experience colours when they think of
specific letters or numbers; others hear music in particular colours.
Brain imaging studies show that when some synaesthetes listen to words
their visual cortex as well as their auditory cortex lights up. For most
people only the auditory cortex is activated.

Dismissed initially as fanciful, synaesthesia is now recognized as a
specific condition and may be more widespread among the population than
was originally thought. After all, not everyone is going to confess to
their friend Derek that his name tastes like ear wax. It may even be
developmental: as babies we may all experience the world in multiple
sensory ways but our brains start to categorize sensory information in a
more rigid way as we develop. And perhaps there is a little bit of the
synaesthete in all of us -- can you identify with the 'sharp' taste of a
lemon, the 'loud' colour of a cotton shirt or how you might 'smell a
rat' when you hear something that seems incorrect?

## []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_89 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 89" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Learning through your senses](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_06_CHAP_C06_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h2_002 .head-a}

Your senses are effectively the only way for the information in the
outside world to get inside your head, so if you're to learn anything
about what's going on in the world, whether it's a new fact, a physical
activity or improving a soft skill like developing your negotiation
skills, the chances are you're going to have to pay attention to what's
going on in that outside world. However, you'll also have to pay
attention to your internal world too, especially if you're learning a
new skill.

While most of us are familiar with the Big Five senses of sight, sound,
touch, taste and smell it seems we owe this to the Greek philosopher
Aristotle and his book *De Anima* (*On the Soul*) (trans.
Lawson-Tancred, 1987) which had a separate chapter for each of what we
now call our main senses. There are still rigorous debates in the
scientific community as to what constitutes a sense but broadly it's
seen as a group of receptors or organs that receive information either
from outside the body (exteroceptive) or from inside (interoceptive).
This information enables you to know what's going on in and outside your
body so that you can make choices as to how to respond; consciously or
unconsciously.

Currently, neuroscientists seem to accept we have 21 different senses.
We'll cover the main five exteroceptive senses in more detail and then
there's a short section on the additional senses you may not have known
you have and how they impact on learning (see [Figure
6.1](#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_Figure_6_1)).

Having no sensory input or a lack of sensory information leads to
hallucinations, depression and other unusual perceptual anomalies.
Sensory deprivation has been used as a method of torture. Our brains are
designed to work with rich sensory input; they don't function well
without our senses feeding them. Rich sensory input is the normal way
for our brains to learn about the world outside our heads. We're
incredibly good at taking in sensory []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_90
.pagebreak aria-label="Page 90" role="doc-pagebreak"}information, but
how much attention do we pay to the quality of what is around us and how
can we improve ours and our learners' ability to learn by using richer,
more sensory inputs?

### Try this exercise {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_001 .head-b}

Think back to your last holiday and identify the first memory that comes
to mind. You may be:

- seeing the world from a different perspective at the top of a high
  mountain

- listening to children shrieking with pleasure as they shout excitedly
  to their friends

- lazing on a warm beach, feeling fine granules of sand running through
  your fingers

- smelling the perfumes of clear night air, unclouded by the fumes of
  the city

- savouring the different and fresh tastes of food sizzling above open
  fires.

Did you see, hear, feel, smell or taste your memory? Go back to that
memory... and now experience it through the rest of your senses. If you
were seeing a new world, what can you bring to mind of what you could
hear? What do you feel when you are there? What can you touch? What
scents are around you? What can you taste? Try to capture all those
sensations that weren't your first memory but are probably still in
there as a deeply encoded experience. When we run this activity at
training events, the typical feedback we get is how much more people
remember when they access all the sensations they experienced at the
time, rather than just their first memory.

This ability to recall sensory information that you may not have
consciously been paying much attention to at the time can help you and
your learners to recall and use information later. That elaborate
sensory experience is still there to build on and as a trainer,
lecturer, teacher or coach you can develop people's ability to learn.

In this chapter you'll look at some of the real-world challenges of
training and information delivery. Then you'll hear about the different
senses and how they're processed in your brain. You'll think about why
and how you can enhance training and learning by increasing the sensory
inputs available and learn about how your sensory perceptions of the
world help to make learning resonant, stronger and more vivid. You'll
explore some practical []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_91 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 91" role="doc-pagebreak"}suggestions as to how you can
create lush, multisensory environments and some new ideas from
technology that can help us learn more effectively by building on our
increasing knowledge about how our senses work and tie into the
processes of learning.

## [Real-world challenges](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_06_CHAP_C06_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h2_003 .head-a}

### 1. Some topics are conceptual and not multisensory {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_002 .head-b}

Many of the things we have to learn at work don't intuitively lend
themselves to multisensory presentations. If you have to train someone
or design some e-learning for the latest health and safety regulations,
or how to do zero-based budgeting or perhaps using macros in Excel, it's
not immediately obvious how you can make these topics multisensory, but
I hope as you go through this book you will begin to see how you can
make these themes come to life for your learners.

### 2. An overemphasis on PowerPoint and textual learning {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_003 .head-b}

Sometimes people get distanced from the learning process and even
practical learning activities can get caught up in a style of training
that actually strips out the sensory information. For example, I came
across someone a few years ago who was asked to train people on cleaning
techniques by talking them through PowerPoint slides! The cleaners and
this poor trainer were sitting in a darkened room learning a structured
cleaning process complete with labels, complicated words and pictures of
mops instead of getting out into the world and cleaning for real.

### 3. Labelling people as particular types of learners -- don't! {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_004 .head-b}

The senses have been used as a way of describing how some people prefer
to learn but there is no evidence to support these or any other
'Learning Styles'. While some people may find they prefer to read the
booklet first and others prefer to hear someone explain what to do
first, there is no evidence to support the concept of multisensory or
any other sort of learning styles. Imagine you are learning to ride a
bike. How useful is it to watch a video or look at pictures and how
quickly do you think you'll learn to ride a bike?
[]{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_92 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 92"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The only way successfully to learn to ride a bike
is to get on one and make lots of mistakes, experience the feedback of
scraped knees and knuckles and get your balance, correct your errors,
practise and practise until finally you're speeding along.

If so far you have had a belief in learning styles but are reading this
book because you're interested in evidence-based learning, you need to
know that in science you can't prove a negative. There's no proof that
learning styles don't exist but there is a lack of evidence that they
do. This doesn't usually feel as satisfying as being able to prove
something and it leaves proponents of particular theories such as
learning styles arguing that the research hasn't been done well enough
yet and that we're just waiting for it. However, assigning learning
styles to students is neither useful nor predictive. A study of anatomy
students in 2015--16 assessed their learning styles and then asked them
to study using that style both in and out of the classroom (Willingham
et al, 2015). They found most students didn't use their so-called
'style' and whether they did or not made no difference to the end
results; it simply didn't create better learning. There are many people
who argue that learning styles can be damaging because it can stereotype
people and prevent them from exploring all possible ways of learning.

What is more useful for learners is to fit the learning strategies to
the material or skills that need to be learnt. To ride a bike or learn
to use a new tool at work uses a strategy based around physically
practising, experimenting and improving your skills over time. If you're
learning information and it's presented as text it might work better to
map out the ideas graphically.

People are not visual, auditory or kinaesthetic learners but we all
benefit from learning through rich multisensory environments. As you go
through this chapter you'll read about visual, auditory, kinaesthetic,
olfactory and gustatory senses because they are familiar terms, but I'm
not talking about Learning Styles.

## [How the senses work](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_06_CHAP_C06_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h2_004 .head-a}

Let's take the processing of your five main senses step by step. Then
we'll examine each sense in more detail and how you can use the senses
to enhance learning, and then we'll dive deeper to look into the rest
and their impact on learning. Let's start with what happens when you
see, hear, feel, smell or taste something.

A sensation is registered in the relevant, specially adapted sensory
organ: your eyes, ears, nose, skin or tongue. Those organs translate
their own []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_93 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 93"
role="doc-pagebreak"}particular stimulus, light or sound waves or
physical vibrations into electrical pulses that pass along your nerves,
through your spinal cord, until they reach your brain. These different
messages are all converted into electrical form inside your brain. Once
they get there they are destined to go to specific sensory areas which
can then process them in greater detail. However, the information is
effectively split into different streams which are also processed by
other parts of your brain in parallel. There's another complication
because in most cases, information from the left side of the body goes
to the right side of the brain, e.g. information coming in from the left
eye goes to the right side of the brain first. And information from the
right side of your body goes to the left side of your brain.

The sensory cortices themselves are split further into distinct areas
that deal with particular stimuli; your visual cortex, for instance, has
areas to deal with colour, movement, shapes and even very specific
stimuli like faces.

Once the information has been registered in your sensory cortex it moves
to something called the association area where different information is
assembled together from other parts of your cortex to give you your own
personal perception of that sensory stimulus. So, for instance, when you
see a particular pen your brain adds in the concepts of writing,
drawing, other types of pens, and memories of the last time you saw that
particular pen.

One of the parallel streams of information passes to your emotional
network so you may well experience an emotional sensation associated
with that particular pen -- perhaps it was one you picked up at a
particularly useful training course or you used to write a love letter.
The emotional data is sent to your cerebral cortex so that you become
consciously aware of seeing that pen and the feeling you associate with
it.

In fact when you see something it is actually a complex set of
activations in different parts of your brain that gives you the
sensation of seeing. Your perceptions are not the real world but what
your brain tells you about the real world. Consequently, your senses are
fallible; sometimes you miss information, sometimes you see things that
aren't there, sometimes you interpret it differently which makes
learning all the trickier because you're really using your slightly
less-than-perfect sensory perceptions to inform you of what's going on.
So there's a lot that can go wrong but, time and time again, research
demonstrates that learning is enhanced through sensory information.

While most of the evidence shows that multisensory learning is valuable,
are there any learning experiences where we might want to turn our
senses off? In a 2008 study, students learnt the mathematical relations
that linked []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_94 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 94" role="doc-pagebreak"}three items in a group. Some
students learnt using metaphorical water jugs and pizza slices while
others learnt the rules using abstract symbols, and these students were
better able to transfer the rules to real-life situations. The team of
scientists at Ohio State University, led by Jennifer Kaminski, thought
that the concrete examples may have made it harder for the children to
transfer the knowledge across to different situations despite them being
more engaging. However, in this study, the water jugs and pizza slices
were only metaphorical. What would have happened if they'd been real and
could have been touched?

Let's examine each sense in a bit more detail and how you can enrich
sensory experiences to make learning stick.

### Sight {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_005 .head-b}

The *visual cortex* sits in your occipital lobe at the back of your
brain and more brainpower is devoted to processing visual information
than the other senses. The visual cortex is split into distinct areas
for processing different elements of vision, e.g. colour, shape, size,
etc. and there are specific neurons that look out for very particular
elements of vision such as neurons that detect corners or straight
lines; even vertical as opposed to horizontal lines.

There is no direct map of what you see in your brain -- the 'map' is
distorted as it is processed. The central area of your visual field has
more neurons and greater cortical area than the peripheral area so your
peripheral vision isn't as strong as your centrally-focused vision. What
you actually see is inverted on the back of the retina so the 'map' in
the brain is upside down but you are used to processing it that way, so
it seems entirely normal to you.

So how does vision enhance your experience of learning? Do pictures help
you to learn better? It seems they do and that most people find pictures
and video improve their ease of learning and the retention of
information.

Drawing something yourself can improve your learning or uptake of
information. Children were asked to learn some biology facts (Schmeck et
al, 2014): some were encouraged to use pictures and draw, while others
worked with text alone. The group who used drawings were about a third
more successful than their peers when they were tested afterwards on a
multiple choice (scoring 61 per cent correct on average versus 44 per
cent) and a drawing test (scoring 52 per cent on average versus 28 per
cent). The researchers believe that drawing has this benefit for
learning because it 'encourages learners to engage in generative
cognitive processing during []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_95 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 95" role="doc-pagebreak"}learning such as organizing
the relevant information into a coherent structure, and integrating it
with relevant prior knowledge from long-term memory'.

While this particular study was conducted with schoolchildren, there's
enough evidence to suggest it's worth asking people at work to draw the
information they need to learn. These researchers acknowledged they
didn't test whether drawing works for all types of information but it
seemed to be effective for causal chains of events -- so if you're
learning a process, drawing should make it easier.

#### Pictures may not always be the answer {.head-c}

If pictures are often easier to understand and more memorable than text
alone is it true in all cases? Sometimes people even worry that they'll
dumb something down by including pictures because it will seem too easy,
though why some people believe learning must be made difficult isn't
clear to me. However, are pictures always the answer?

Researchers writing in the *British Journal of Educational Psychology*
(Prangsma et al, 2009) showed that academic achievement may not always
be improved by the use of diagrams. History students showed no real
difference in their learning when tested, regardless of whether they'd
learnt using illustrations or text or both. So perhaps using pictures
doesn't always help to make the point or make information more
memorable. However, one interesting finding was that students *felt* the
information was easier to understand and they had learnt better when
they had pictures as well as text. So what's the implication of people
thinking the information is easier to understand?

Feeling better about information can't be underestimated. The
researchers said: 'The goal of educational motivation is not only to
make learning more efficient... or effective... but also to make
learning more pleasant such that the affective learning experience is
more satisfying and learners will want to learn more'. You've already
covered the importance of motivation in learning, which is particularly
relevant when you need people to learn on their own or to encourage them
to come back for more training. When people enjoy the experience of
receiving the information they are more inclined to engage with it and
make the effort to process and understand it. So while pictures may not
*always* make a difference as to how well something is remembered they
do make a difference to the motivation levels. And, importantly,
pictures don't seem to make learning any worse.

#### []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_96 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 96" role="doc-pagebreak"}The impact of colour on learning {.head-c}

As a highly visual signal, does colour make a difference to people's
learning? Colours affect how we pay attention and our levels of arousal.
Higher attention and arousal levels increase our ability to learn. We
pay more attention to warm colours such as yellow, red and orange
compared to the cool colours like brown and grey. People show faster
response times when identifying the differences in colours compared to
differences in the shapes of objects, indicating that colours have a
better and greater ability to capture attention than other variables.
Colour helps with remembering information but it needs to be consistent.
If the information appears in red as people are learning, it needs to
appear in red again when they are retrieving the information later.

#### What else can colour do for you, the trainer? {.head-c}

Surprisingly, as a trainer, teacher or learning facilitator the colour
you wear may have an impact on the learning. As one of the most
significant motivators to learning you need to feel on top of your game
and wearing red can help you feel more confident. The colour red has
been shown to increase testosterone levels in sports players and improve
their chances of victory. So, if you wake up feeling less confident than
usual, then grab that red shirt to convey to yourself and your learners
that you're confident they will learn well today.

You'll explore some more about the psychology of colour in [Chapter
12](#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml) when we consider the environment because colour
can induce different emotional and motivational states in people.

#### Top Tips for using visuals {.head-c}

When you're teaching a new procedure, experiment with handouts with text
labels and ask people to draw the relevant procedure or the sequence of
events. Or you could encourage them to draw the process from scratch
once it's been explained. Not everyone is initially comfortable with
their drawing skills so reassure people they don't need to be Leonardo
da Vinci; a few stick men and blobs will usually be better than text
alone.

Ask people to mind map information rather than take notes because mind
maps are more visual than text. Increase their visual impact with
pictures, colour, highlighting, arrows and differing text sizes.

When using images of people, pay attention to where the attention of
those people is focused. If their gaze extends to some point of
observation beyond the border of the graphic, we tend to be drawn to
follow their focus []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_97 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 97" role="doc-pagebreak"}so don't look at the slide.
Therefore, face pictures of people into the graphic when you want your
images to take centre stage.

If you're training virtually you'll probably need to use more visuals
rather than fewer. People are wired to pay attention to 'change' so keep
visual change happening with plenty of visual slides, pictures rather
than text, short video segments, or virtual whiteboards. You will appeal
to parts of the brain that notice change and you'll be telling people,
'If you look away, you'll miss something.' This is intense for you and
your learners so don't keep it up for a whole day. Deliver for no more
than 10 minutes and only include one point per slide -- or you might
even make one point across two slides. Hand control of the whiteboard
over to your users and let them create graphics, sketches or doodles to
illustrate their thoughts.

Create visual slides and build them into a concert review to play at the
end of a learning programme. See [Chapter 11](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml),
'Review and reflect', for details of how to do this.

Use the same colours, pictures and symbols on all your graphics, slides,
whiteboards, notes, posters, etc. to relate to the same piece of
learning. This helps with encoding and retrieval of information by
associating the same images with the same ideas.

Encourage people to make huge wall murals with coloured craft or
flipchart paper because then people feel ownership as well as having
strong visual reminders of what they are learning.

Use digital tools where learners can input their own ideas and
collaborate.

Work with graphic recorders -- people who help you create graphics and
images about the learning as it happens.

Rather than always using slide presentations, create flash cards instead
for inputting information and reviewing. The beauty of flash cards is
they are not serial like slides. You can shuffle them, show them and
stick them on a wall and they remain there for the rest of your training
session. People don't have to hold information in their working memory
in the same way as they do with slides.

Highlight different materials with different colours or, better still,
ask the learners to do it -- though bear in mind that it's a learning
myth that highlighting text is a useful way to learn. People need to
recall rather than recognize (as you'll find out in [Chapter
9](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml) on meaningful memories).

If you regularly draw, then a short course on drawing graphics will
increase your confidence enormously. When you use an image regularly you
[]{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_98 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 98"
role="doc-pagebreak"}can create a poster -- permanent marker on 'magic
whiteboard' can be brilliant.

Use a variety of visual media: diagrams, charts, timelines, cartoons,
animations, film clips, video, DVD, in a blended approach. Just make
sure you've got permission to use them if you didn't create them
yourself.

Good visual animations can enhance e-learning. But what can you build in
to enable the learner to contribute to the visual elements? Most
e-learning software lets users add text but how often can learners draw?

### Sound {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_006 .head-b}

When sound is transmitted it goes from each ear to both left and right
hemispheres of your brain, but most of the sound from the left ear goes
to the right hemisphere and vice versa. Both hemispheres have different
roles in processing sound information, so sounds will be experienced
differently depending on the ear they enter. For example, a person who
is deaf in the right ear may find words more difficult to distinguish
than music because words are processed mainly in the left hemisphere
whereas music is processed mainly in the right.

We are used to the idea of learning from sounds as we learn because most
of us have had the experience of being talked to or lectured at. It may
even be that if you're looking at slides you're actually hearing because
some studies suggest that seeing text on a screen causes you, in effect,
to hear that information in your head and subsequently to encode it as
verbal information.

So how effective is sound and auditory information in learning? There's
far less research done on auditory than on visual learning and like most
of the research done in laboratories it's usually extremely specific and
not always directly applicable to the real world. For instance, research
focuses on whether people can learn to tell the difference between two
tones or two different frequencies of sound which is great for detailed
research, but unless someone is specifically having to learn to do that
as part of their job it doesn't help you in the more practical world of
learning at work.

Sound is serial rather than parallel. While you can scan a picture over
and over again, once you've heard something it's gone and needs to be
repeated for you to hear it again, so in some ways it's harder to listen
and process sound than pictures. Fortunately, we are helped by something
called echoic memory. Have you ever been really immersed in something
when somebody says something to you and you say, 'What did you say?' but
even as you say []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_99 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 99" role="doc-pagebreak"}it you realize you've heard
what they said? That's your echoic working memory replaying what you
heard so you can hear it again. Your echoic memories are short, only
holding about 3--4 seconds' worth of information. This form of sensory
memory passes information to your short-term memory but it's easily
disrupted.

Studies show that when you're distracted while you encode information,
your initial learning is disrupted so it is important to reduce noise
distraction. Many parents of teenagers will recognize the experience of
asking them how on earth they can concentrate on their school work while
listening to music on their headphones. Does listening to music while
they're learning help them or not? Oddly enough, it may depend on what
they are listening to and whether the music is acoustically varied,
which is typical of pop music. When students were tested on a memory
task they performed worst when listening to pop music they liked but
their performance was better when the music was 'a cacophony of sound,
in which the segmentation of each individual sound from the next is
difficult to identify' (Perham and Sykora, 2012). Unsurprisingly, for
most parents, their performance was improved when they had to learn in
silence. However, music can be used to block out external distractions
so the case is not fully made for silence.

#### Listening to information as you sleep {.head-c}

In the past, a lot of research focused on the idea that people could
learn while listening to information as they slept, but sadly the
results consistently indicate that this is not going to help you become
fluent in Spanish or remember the key facts for an exam. However, while
we're on the topic of sleep there was an interesting experiment that
showed that sleep may be more important to learning than auditory input.

A particular study looked at whether playing sounds and associating them
with pictures of objects would increase people's ability to remember the
specific location of the object. Subjects saw 50 objects in specific
locations on a computer screen, and at the same time they heard a
relevant noise; for instance, a kettle was paired with a whistle and a
cat with a meow. They were then tested as to how well they knew the
location of the object to set a baseline. As part of the experiment,
subjects were then allowed to nap but while they slept the researchers
played the sounds of 25 of the objects. The subjects were then better at
locating the objects for which they'd heard the sound, while asleep,
than the 25 objects without the sound cue. However, on further study it
turned out that it was actually letting subjects sleep that made a
difference rather than the sound. When people were tested without
[]{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_100 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 100"
role="doc-pagebreak"}sleep, but with the sound cues, there was no
difference in the results of cued and uncued objects.

There's a lot more on sleep in [Chapter 13](#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml), which
is dedicated to sleep and learning.

#### Does music make you smarter? {.head-c}

You may have heard that listening to Mozart makes you smarter and if you
do an internet search you'll find plenty of information to tell you that
music helps you think better, study better or generally become more
intelligent. Much of this data seems to stem from an original piece of
research in 1993 by a psychologist called Frances Rauscher (et al) who
reported findings of 'enhanced spatial task performance' among college
students after exposure to Mozart's music. These findings were
overinterpreted to lead to the popular 'Mozart Effect' myth.

Subsequent analysis (called meta-analysis) of multiple experiments and
papers shows that the accumulated evidence does not demonstrate any
enhanced abilities through listening to Mozart. There do seem to be some
short-term effects on temporary arousal and positive emotions from
listening to certain types of music, and learning to play music may help
children develop their working memory so helping them to learn languages
and to read.

One of the hardest things when you start learning a foreign language is
working out where one word starts and another ends and music has been
found to help here. First of all, music is more emotional than spoken
language but, when that was controlled for, people still learnt made-up
words more easily. What seemed to make a significant difference was that
music gave people statistical information about which syllables tend to
follow each other in words, and which don't; this helped them to segment
the different parts of the words. So for language learning, music may
well be a valuable tool, certainly as you start to learn the language.
There's also some evidence from Cambridge University that suggests that
training specific rhythm and sound differentiation may help children
with dyslexia learn to read more easily (Bhide, Power and Goswami,
2013).

#### Music to change the emotional context for learning {.head-c}

We've already discussed how being motivated is vital for learning and
we'll go on to consider the use of emotions in learning, so perhaps
music can be used to change people's emotional states and therefore
readiness to learn even if it doesn't actually make you smarter. You may
be aware that major []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_101 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 101" role="doc-pagebreak"}and minor keys can sound
happy or sad respectively and it's thought this might be linked to our
speech patterns. An experiment in 2010 (Muir, 2010) found that the
frequency relationships in excited speech closely matched those of music
in major keys, while those of 'forlorn' speech matched minor music. The
team also found the same association for Mandarin Chinese speakers,
suggesting the link is common to different cultures, if not universal.
So, you may potentially induce different emotional states in your
learners through your own tonality. And, of course, you can play music
in major or minor keys to change the mood too. My favourite virtual
learning specialist, Jo Cook of Lightbulb Moment, almost always has some
upbeat music playing as people enter the virtual space which serves to
create the mood Jo intends.

#### Top Tips for using sound more {.head-c}

We pay attention to change so, as a trainer, vary the voices that people
hear. Instead of you speaking or reading, encourage your audience to
take turns reading out loud from books, handouts and documents.

Pre-record some material and play it in the background while other, less
cognitive tasks are being performed. This is a form of priming and while
not everyone will consciously be aware of the information it will have
been processed at one level or another.

Instead of always presenting information as prose, how about creating a
poem, song, rap or jingle or, better still, ask your learners to create
their own? There's some interesting research that suggests we believe
information that rhymes more than the same information written as prose,
even if we don't think we'll be hoodwinked by such a simple suggestion.

Another way to use music in a training environment is to condition
particular pieces of music to particular activities. So, for instance,
at the start of a training programme play a particular tune to signal
the end of break, play it consistently and eventually learners recognize
that the end of break has arrived and you'll find they come back to the
learning space without you having to shepherd them back.

### Touch, movement and the kinesthetic sense {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_007 .head-b}

You may hear the phrase 'kinesthetic sense' when people talk about touch
and movement.

You've got lots of information feeding into your body that creates
different physical sensations. *Touch* is a perception resulting from
activation of []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_102 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 102" role="doc-pagebreak"}neural receptors, generally
in the skin, but also in the tongue, throat, and mucous membranes. A
variety of *pressure* receptors respond to differences in pressure. You
also have *temperature* receptors in your skin.

Your motor cortex runs over the top of your head like a hairband -- ear
to ear -- and tells you where your body is, among other things.
Proprioception, sometimes called a 'sixth sense' of body awareness, is
the equivalent of an internal touch; one example is you know where your
limbs are in relation to the world.

While information comes into your brain primarily through the senses,
your control of movement happens in the cerebellum in the brainstem. It
passes information backwards and forwards from the sensory systems to
other parts of your brain and is highly connected to all parts of the
brain associated with learning. In this section, you'll also consider
the inputs that movement give us when learning and you'll revisit the
importance of moving again in other chapters.

Do touch and movement help with learning? Clearly, if you're learning a
physical skill actually doing the task is vital to perfecting the skill;
if you're learning to do something simple like thread a needle you can
feel the thread and the needle and your brain puts all the sensory
information together to tell you where the two objects are in relation
to each other so you can bring them together. But do touch and movement
help in other ways when you're learning something conceptual?

There are many reasons for moving while learning, not the least of which
is that your brain requires oxygen, and one way to get oxygen to the
brain is to move. Even standing can raise heart rate (hence, blood flow)
by as much as 5 to 8 per cent in just seconds (Krock and Hartung, 1992).
So possibly you'd be able to read this book much better if you were
standing up.

There's more and more evidence that our brains need movement to function
well and that our cognitive skills are enhanced for the short and long
term by being active. John Medina's excellent book *Brain Rules* (2008)
has a whole chapter devoted to the importance of movement.

#### Top Tips for stimulating a sense of touch {.head-c}

- Stimulate touch by providing information on cards that people can
  hold, organize, move around.

- Give out black-and-white handouts to colour in -- you've got the
  double impact of visual stimulation and movement.

- Physically pace out concepts; walk them through.

- []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_103 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 103"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Develop physical mind maps -- lay them out on the
  floor.

- Put information into puzzles -- a jigsaw puzzle can be visual and
  tactile at the same time.

- Build models of concepts and let people walk around them or hold them.

- You can have key facts written onto physical objects like magic cubes
  (a bit like Rubik's cubes) or banner pens.

- Use the real world of concrete objects as much as you can -- explain
  concepts using real physical metaphors. I saw one client explain the
  complex technology of the crystals behind e-reader screens using a
  small electric candle and an origami cube.

- Encourage touch in digital learning too; invite people to write or
  draw in learning logs, send materials to construct, set tasks in the
  real world to report back, use sensory language.

With some energetic learners you might invite them to create human
sculptures of models, as shown in [Figure
6.2](#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_Figure_6_2).

### Smell and learning {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_008 .head-b}

*Smell* or *olfaction* is one of the chemical senses and, unlike the
other senses, odours are processed on the same side of the brain as the
detector, your nostril. The olfactory cortex is nearer the front of your
brain, so it's very close to your nose! Smell is your most primitive
sense and, unlike other senses, your olfactory perceptions are not
directed through the thalamus but go directly to the limbic system. This
fast route to your emotional centre gives smell the power to elicit
strong memories -- consider how the smell of cabbage or changing rooms
can take you straight back to learning at school!

Smell can influence your emotional responses, heart rate, blood pressure
and respiration and we know that the neuronal substrates of olfaction
(the parts of the brain that underlie our experience of smell) are
especially geared for associative learning and emotional processing. The
olfactory bulbs directly connect with structures that process emotion
(the amygdala) and associative learning (the hippocampus). No other
sensory system has this type of intimate link with the emotional areas
of your brain, creating a strong neurological basis for why odours
trigger emotional connections.

A number of studies have shown that the odours people like make them
feel good, whereas odours people dislike make them feel bad. These mood
responses have also been reported physiologically. For example, skin
[]{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_105 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 105"
role="doc-pagebreak"}conductance, heart-rate and eye-blink rates in
response to various liked or disliked scents coincide with the mood the
person is experiencing; and of course how we feel can affect how we
learn. Pleasant smells mainly light up your frontal lobe's olfactory
area while unpleasant smells activate both the amygdala (associated with
negative emotion) and the cortex in the temporal lobe (processes sound,
speech comprehension and memory).

It seems that people in a positive mood can be more creative and that
odours can have the same effect; when people smelled something they
liked, their creative problem-solving improved compared to smelling
something unpleasant. Pleasant smells may also increase attention during
tedious tasks, though this is not an excuse to create a boring learning
event and improve it with the smell of roasting coffee. And if there is
an unpleasant smell around it may lower people's tolerance for
frustration, so there's another reason to pay attention to the
environment people are in when they learn.

Unfortunately you can't just decide to use a particular scent to evoke a
particular emotion. It seems the pleasantness or not of scents is
personally and culturally conditioned and is due to associative
learning. In an experiment by the US Army to create a universal stink
bomb they couldn't find any universally disliked smell (*New Scientist*,
2001).

### A sense of taste {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_009 .head-b}

*Taste* or *gustation* is the other chemical sense. This sense may not
be as readily applied to learning in a formal setting unless the
learning is specifically food-related where taste is going to be vitally
important; for instance a wine-tasting course or learning to be a tea
taster. However, it is still possible to appeal to this sense while
learning. Facilitators will recognize the well-known 'happy sheet'
scenario where the most positive mention is about lunch!

A strong taste can bring back amazing memories or cause us to behave
quite out of character in that we might spit it out, even in public.
What's the neuroscience of taste?

Taste activates the amygdala and the dopaminergic system so is closely
connected to reward and aversion. Therefore, you might use
pleasant-tasting food as a reward for learning. While your mouth can
taste sweet, salt, sour and umami, it seems there are 'hot spots' in
your gustatory cortex for the main tastes of sweet, salt and umami but
not one for sour tastes.

Most of the neuroscience research on taste is on taste aversion and
there's almost none on whether taste can help us learn other things
better. You can []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_106 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 106" role="doc-pagebreak"}link tastes to learning as
anchors rather than them being a specific way to absorb information.

For instance, we run a session explaining the main brain structures to
our participants. Throughout the session, we use chocolate as a link to
the brain -- they see it, smell it and taste it -- and ask people to
think about what they learnt about the brain whenever they see or taste
chocolate in the future. When we see people many months and even years
later, if we ask them about chocolate they are always able to recall
what they learnt about the brain. They have associated chocolate with
thinking about brain structures.

#### Top Tips for using olfactory and gustatory senses {.head-c}

- Use images and props with food content -- most people will get a taste
  for this theme.

- Choose spaces with natural air -- open the windows regularly.

- Spray scents around the room to stimulate different reactions.

- Food and drink metaphors and stories are easy to swallow!

- Use scented pens.

- Handouts can be impregnated by placing them in a warm, scented place.

- Make eating/drinking/celebrating part of the learning -- a
  multicultural feast, barbecue, picnic, tapas, etc.

- Flowers and plants add colour and scent.

- Be subtle and aware that people may react strongly to some scents for
  personal or health reasons.

- Learn specific topics with a specific scent on a tissue and then take
  the same scent into an exam to promote recall.

### Additional senses {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_010 .head-b}

Some of the additional senses have already been mentioned within the
'kinaesthetic' section but we're going to classify them more clearly
here.

First, they are separated into exteroceptive senses which perceive the
body's position, motion and state and then interoceptive senses that
tell you what is happening inside your body.

Your **exteroceptive** senses include:

- balance (equilibrioception)

- where the parts of your body are in space (proprioception)

- []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_107 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 107"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}being able to detect temperature differences
  (thermoception)

- sensing pain (nociception).

These are important for learning physical skills of any sort as are some
of the interoceptive receptors.

**Interoceptive** senses tell you what's happening as a response to
changes within your body and internal organs and some, such as cutaneous
receptors in the skin that measure touch, pressure, vibration, are also
valuable for learning motor skills.

Interoceptive senses also include a wide range of what we often refer to
as feelings, for example, hunger, thirst, needing to go to the toilet.

When you feel 'unwell' it's your interoceptive senses registering that
you feel nauseous or want to gag, for instance. Most of them are
relevant to learning at work because they are potentially distracting
but they do make learning 'sticky'. If something makes you vomit you
usually don't want to eat it again or if something causes pain you learn
to avoid it a second time. But they're unlikely to be the sort of
learning we want to design at work.

Some scientists suggest we have another type of senses that are usually
detected by a complex network of brain, and body, regions rather than a
specific sensor. Experiences such as a sense of:

- Time, which is measured by a diverse group of brain areas including
  the suprachiasmatic nucleus (see [Chapter 13](#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml) on
  sleep).

- Personal 'agency' or control, which is sometimes disrupted in people
  who have schizophrenia and who then believe they are being controlled
  by external forces. It could be argued this sense may be important for
  a motivation to learn we feel autonomous and in control.

- Familiarity, which we already discussed in terms of recall and
  recognition. Research shows it's easier to learn new information if
  you are already familiar with the chunks that make up that
  information, probably because it places less strain on working memory.
  Researcher Lynne M Reder (Reder et al, 2015) says, 'Learning requires
  bricks not sand'. Previously unknown parts of the brain have also been
  identified as able to distinguish between familiar or unfamiliar faces
  (Rockefeller University, 2017). One area is associated with
  declarative memory and the other in a region that processes social
  knowledge. Researchers were able to record the 'aha' moment in these
  areas when rhesus monkeys, who have similar facial recognition systems
  to ours, recognized the familiar faces.

### []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_108 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 108" role="doc-pagebreak"}Multisensory learning -- an experiment {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h3_011 .head-b}

One of our colleagues, Nicki Davey from Saltbox Training, ran a session
where we became her experimental guinea pigs. Her premise was that
learning through a more multisensory experience would be more effective.
In true scientific style she set up three experimental groups to
generate ideas about 'oranges' in five minutes:

- Group 1 -- had a blank piece of paper to receive their multiple ideas.

- Group 2 -- had a picture of a lovely juicy orange, and a blank piece
  of paper.

- Group 3 -- had an orange, an orange board, an orange knife, and a
  blank piece of paper.

Group 1 identified many fascinating and interesting ideas about oranges
including links to orange-related literature and films: *Oranges Are Not
the Only Fruit* and *A Clockwork Orange*.

Group 2 waxed lyrical about the 'community of orange' -- how within the
skin of an orange are segments, which contain little sacs of juice and
how they all work together to be an orange. And they came up with lots
of ideas about orange-coloured items, including jumpsuits from
Guantanamo Bay.

In Group 3 we cut up our orange, smelled it, tasted it, looked at it and
discussed ideas and memories about oranges themselves: how warm and
sunny it is where they grow, the way they get stuck in your teeth, how
to make false teeth out of the skin, how sticky they are on your
hands...

There was definitely a difference in the types of ideas we all had which
got us talking about creativity as well as multisensory learning.

But Nicki wasn't satisfied with just generating ideas -- she wanted to
test our memories. So she distracted us with another task where we
produced *72 ways to make learning multisensory*. Then Nicki asked us to
recall what we'd had on our lists about oranges. The groups which didn't
have the multisensory orange experience *recalled 17 of their ideas*
(pretty impressive), but Group 3, who had had all their senses
stimulated, *recalled 33 ideas in the time available*. In fact we were
remembering the ideas so quickly that all of us wrote at once in order
to keep up and we were frustrated by being stopped because we knew we
hadn't captured them all.

There are many serious scientific experiments showing the value of
multisensory stimuli in learning but this was an easy and practical way
to demonstrate how much more powerful memory is when you stimulate the
sensory []{#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml_page_109 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 109"
role="doc-pagebreak"}cortices rather than just enlist the frontal
cortex. I can still remember the feeling of how sticky my hands were!

## [Summary](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_06_CHAP_C06_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml__06_CHAP_C06_h2_005 .head-a}

What you've covered in this chapter:

- We process information from our multiple senses both internal and
  external.

- Each of the five main external senses has its own dedicated sensory
  area in your cortex.

- Apart from smell, the other four external senses are routed through
  the thalamus before being sent off for parallel processing throughout
  your brain creating rich emotional memories associated with the
  senses.

- Making learning more multisensory makes it more 'sticky'.

- Vision is usually the strongest sense; providing visual information
  helps more people learn more easily.

There you are, minding your own business, when you see someone looking
intently at something. Do you look away or do you find yourself being
irresistibly drawn to whatever they're looking at? It seems we find it
almost impossible not to follow someone else's gaze and focus our
attention on the same things they are looking at. Magicians and
pickpockets use this distraction technique regularly to get you to look
in a different direction to their sleight of hand.

A study in Italy in 2012 (Galfano et al) asked subjects to look at a
target that appeared on the left or right of a screen, and to make it
really easy, in one trial the target always appeared in the same place
and in another the words 'sinistra' (left) or 'destra' (right) appeared
to tell the subjects where to look. However, like all good psychology
experiments it wasn't that easy and subjects, in some circumstances,
also saw a cartoon face, or an arrow, that they were told to ignore. But
they just couldn't. When they saw the face or the arrow pointing towards
the opposite side to the target they were significantly slower at
looking at the target. The scientists concluded that their attention was
momentarily distracted and evidence from studies with babies shows we're
practically hard-wired to follow the gaze of other people.

If you're a trainer this may be important to you -- where are you gazing
and therefore what are you drawing attention to? If you're designing
learning then you need to ensure that you're directing attention where
you need it.

## []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_112 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 112" role="doc-pagebreak"}[What attention is and why you need it in learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_07_CHAP_C07_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h2_002 .head-a}

Sometimes people say they aren't good learners or they have a terrible
memory but perhaps they aren't paying sufficient attention. But what is
attention? At a basic level, attention is about security -- we pay
attention to things because they could be a threat and we need to stay
safe or because they are important to us.

In this chapter you'll read about your brain's systems of attention,
your attention span and whether your attention is internal or external.
Then you'll uncover some of the things that can help to focus and
distract attention (see [Figure

## [System of attention](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_07_CHAP_C07_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h2_003 .head-a}

Attention comes in three parts: arousal, orientation and focus. This
means you first of all need to be alert enough to attend to something,
then you direct your attention to the particular stimulus and finally
you focus on it. When something captures your attention you immediately
go into a state of arousal -- a bus passes your window, or you hear
someone shout. The external stimulus grabs your attention and your
reticular activating system, just at the top of your brainstem, goes on
the alert. It releases a burst of adrenaline which travels around your
body to put you on alert. Activity in other parts of your brain closes
down and goes quiet. If you were to do a brain scan just at that arousal
point you'd see that a lot of the brain is inactive, quietened and not
firing or sending messages.

[]{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_113 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 113"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Once you're alert, your superior colliculus in your
midbrain starts to orientate towards the source of the alert, looking
for clues as to what's made you pay attention. Rats with damaged
superior colliculi can't make meaningful directional movement to the
source of a stimulus; they tend to be initially frozen and then become
hyperactive (Harrison et al, 1984). And at the same time your parietal
cortex tells your brain to disengage from what you're doing now and to
pay attention to this novel stimulus that's attracted your attention.

Now you're alert and orientated towards the source of the stimulus you
can focus on this new stimulus. A part of your thalamus, the lateral
pulvinar, which is slightly higher up in your midbrain, shunts
information into your frontal lobes for you to start to make sense of
it. Remember that one of the functions of the thalamus is to relay
sensory information into your sensory cortices and it's very well
connected with multiple parts of your brain.

In the case of a bus going past your window... you've heard the noise,
felt the adrenaline, and turned to look at what's made the noise before
you know what's happening. And then your frontal cortex processes the
degree of threat and recognizes that it's just a noisy bus, it's nothing
to do with you, it's continuing on its journey and you can go back to
writing your report.

When you're learning something, you need to pay attention because
otherwise the information doesn't register to be processed into your
memory properly. When you're learning you need to keep your alert focus
for longer than the time for a bus to pass your window -- you need to
sustain your attention. As you've just read, it's a complex process and
you'll remember from earlier chapters that your brain uses a lot of
energy in directing attention and processing information, which is one
reason why staying alert for long is tiring and can become stressful.

## [Attention span](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_07_CHAP_C07_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h2_004 .head-a}

The amount of time you can sustain focused attention is a complex and
disputed territory and is affected by numerous factors, such as whether
you're being observed, which makes experiments in laboratories somewhat
trickier to control for. There are many estimates of human attention
span ranging from 5 to about 20 minutes, though we can choose to refocus
at the end of an attention span if we're sufficiently engaged. Of
course, attention span is also affected by what other distractions are
happening too. In a cinema you can pay attention to a long film because
they turn off the lights, []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_114 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 114" role="doc-pagebreak"}ask you to switch off your
phone, increase the volume and bombard you with dramatic, changing
images and sounds. Your attention is constantly pulled back to the
action on the screen, but blockbusters spend millions of dollars on
getting your attention. How can you compete with your limited training
budget?

In the world of digital workplace learning, attention is easily pulled
away from the task in hand because of so many competing stimuli.
Interestingly, a study with children shows this might be valuable for
learning. While focused on a computer-based task, adults have learnt to
be more efficient by focusing on particular objects whereas 4 and 5 year
olds' eyes tend to wander all over the screen as they try to complete
the task. However, the children learnt better if the task unexpectedly
changed because they noticed important things on the screen that the
adults weren't paying attention to (Blanco et al, 2023).

## [Attention from inside and outside](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_07_CHAP_C07_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h2_005 .head-a}

Attention can be provoked by internal or external stimuli. Imagine those
times when you're sitting on the train, completely lost in a wonderful
book that captures your imagination so that you don't notice the
shrieking children, ringing phones or even that they've just announced
your stop. Compare it to trying to pay attention to a not terribly
interesting report on the train and all you are aware of is how sticky
that child's hands are and how likely it is to spill its drink over your
new suit.

When you pay attention to what's going on in your head it's as if your
sensory input is tuned down, so you don't notice all the sensory stimuli
that bombard your brain constantly. Your anterior cingulate cortex is
active and this part of your brain helps you maintain internal focus. It
also registers pain and emotions. In fact, your brain can't really tell
the difference between external pain and emotional pain. Studies have
shown that the pain of social isolation can be reduced by taking aspirin
in the same way as if you actually had a headache. The anterior
cingulate cortex has been implicated in certain sorts of depression
because it seems to keep people fixed and focused on internal stimuli.

Conversely, when you're paying attention to the outside world your
internal systems are turned down and the sensory cortices are more
activated. Think about when you're really paying attention to something
that's external -- perhaps dancing to your favourite music or watching a
brilliant []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_115 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 115" role="doc-pagebreak"}film -- and how you don't
really notice what your thoughts are because your references are to the
outside world. That's where your attention lies -- you are so fascinated
you don't notice the worrying, nagging feeling that you had all day or
even the headache you had earlier.

So if you want people to learn, how do you encourage people to pay
attention? They may need to attend to you, to the content, to their
bodies, to their thoughts, to their colleagues; whatever it is that is
going to provide a source of information.

You'll uncover these options in more detail as you continue to read this
chapter:

- Find the Goldilocks level of arousal -- not too much and not too
  little.

- Make the level of processing complex enough.

- Consider whether multitasking is helping.

- Assess multisensory input.

- Get people into flow and help time to fly.

- Increase the levels of self-reference.

- Increase levels of exercise.

- Direct attention to what's important.

### Give Goldilocks the attention she deserves {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h3_001 .head-b}

For anyone who doesn't know the story of Goldilocks, it is the tale of a
little girl who goes wandering in the woods and finds an empty house and
goes inside. She tries eating the porridge that's been left on the table
and finds one portion too hot, one too cold and one just right. She does
a similar thing testing out the chairs and eventually the beds, where
she falls asleep on the 'just right' bed. She's discovered by the bears
who live in the house and depending on which story you hear she either
runs away, gets eaten or becomes best friends with the bears. The point
is that she was always comparing things and looking for the optimum
level.

One way to make sure you have attention is to keep people's levels of
stress at the Goldilocks level. In psychology and neuroscience we don't
describe stress as the unpleasant thing we talk about in everyday life
-- it is just a measure of the level of arousal someone feels.

The *Yerkes--Dodson law* shows the relationship between arousal and
performance and was originally developed by psychologists Robert M
Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson in 1908. The law dictates that
[]{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_116 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 116"
role="doc-pagebreak"}performance increases with your physiological or
mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become
too high, performance decreases (see [Figure
7.2](#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_Figure_7_2)). Of course, the type
of activity has a strong part to play in this and the original
Yerkes--Dodson law noted the difference between easy activities where
performance keeps increasing and more novel or difficult activities.

When you are in a low level of arousal, your stress level is low and
your performance on the task is low. Both can increase, moving through
an optimal level of stress for the task and maximum performance, until
you potentially reach a level of high stress, which is distress, and
performance falls again.

At low levels of psychologically defined stress, when you're practically
asleep, your performance on focused cognitive activities is going to be
reduced. You won't really be paying attention or able to learn much
because you're just too laid back. Once you reach too high a level of
stress your performance on cognitive activities is impaired because,
with high levels of adrenaline and cortisol rushing around your body,
you're prepared for fight or flight rather than balanced analysis.

The optimal levels of arousal, sometimes called eustress, are where
performance on cognitive tasks reaches its peak. This is the Goldilocks
level of stress -- not too little and not too much. As a trainer this is
probably about where you want your students to be for the best chance of
learning something cognitively new or challenging.

[]{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_117 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 117"
role="doc-pagebreak"}So how do you start to move people to eustress,
keep people's attention from wandering, and make learning interesting
enough that they are paying attention to what they need to?

### Make the level of processing complex enough to pay attention {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h3_002 .head-b}

The more deeply you process information the more attention you pay to
it. This also helps you to remember it. So, how can you increase the
complexity of information to just the right level?

Much of the information we encounter at work, in school or academia is
presented to us through language, so should you use simple language and
dumb things down or should you use complex language to help people
learn? We'll talk about language briefly later in [Chapter
12](#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml), but what you'll consider here is the lexical
complexity of the language you use.

Language can be processed at a structural, phonological or semantic
level. For instance, think of the word 'house'. If you were to process
it at a structural level you're asking about the structure of the word
itself; for instance, 'What is the first vowel in this word?' At a
phonological or lexical level the processing is more complex; for
instance, 'What rhymes with this word?' And finally, at a semantic level
you're thinking about the meaning of the word which is much more
cognitively stimulating; for example, 'What do you do in this place?'
What types of responses do you want from your questions?

There are plenty of psychological studies that show we pay attention and
learn more easily when there is a higher level of complexity or
processing challenge. Many of these studies have been conducted using TV
shows to test what keeps people's attention but one study focused on
looking at extracts from radio (Potter and Callison, 2000). Results
showed that when auditory complexity was higher people reported feeling
more alert and their physiological levels of arousal were also
increased. For instance, they showed an increased heart rate.
Interestingly, people were also more inclined to rate the messages more
positively and they remembered them better than simple messages. They
created these structurally complex radio messages by using multiple
voice changes, sound effects, music onsets, and/or production effects
while the structurally simple messages contained only a few of those
features. The researchers concluded that 'variation in auditory
complexity has greater effect on attention behaviour than variation in
visual complexity in commercials'. This study, contrasted with studies
on visual stimuli, []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_118 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 118" role="doc-pagebreak"}suggested that sounds can
draw our attention back to something because we can still hear them even
when our visual attention has wandered off. For these experiments it
seemed something as simple as a change from one announcer to another did
the trick in recapturing attention, which probably means that having one
person lecturing or talking in a webinar for up to an hour is probably
not the greatest attention-grabbing tool of all -- or at least you're
going to have to work much harder in other ways to keep people's
attention. This will be even more vital when you're working in a virtual
classroom or e-learning because of the ease with which other
distractions can draw attention.

### Multitasking and attention {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h3_003 .head-b}

People love to say they can or they can't multitask but the research
seems to consistently demonstrate that whichever side of the fence you
fall on you won't perform as well on each task if you multitask rather
than focus. I'm focusing on writing this book right now by being alone,
turning off my e-mail, sitting out of my usual 'work space' and
surrounding myself by materials related to the book. You might be
reading it sitting on a train, in an office or possibly even sitting on
the beach. Are you multitasking while you read? David Rock in *Your
Brain at Work* (2009) says that multitasking is like trying to keep
multiple actors on stage at the same time, all of whom demand the
limelight. Multitasking impacts on your working memory, drains your
mental resources and affects how well you encode information into
long-term memory.

You can switch your attention rapidly from one task to another and this
change of focus may help your attention levels, so perhaps there is some
value in multitasking if performance is less of an issue. For example,
many people now enjoy watching a sporting event on the television,
talking to whoever is with them and following social media at the same
time -- it probably doesn't matter if your performance on all tasks
isn't 100 per cent focused. And I suspect most people can manage to make
a cup of tea, carry on a conversation and keep an eye on what their
children are doing in the garden without any significant drop in
performance. In the chapter devoted to digital learning, you'll find out
that games players actually improve their multitasking abilities.

### []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_119 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 119" role="doc-pagebreak"}When multisensory may not be the right thing {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h3_004 .head-b}

If you're reading these chapters in logical order you've probably just
read the one urging you to use lots of multisensory input because it
helps us to encode information more strongly, which improves recall
later. But is it always crucial to use multisensory inputs?

Do you remember your brain switches activity to either the anterior
cingulate cortex or your sensory cortices when you're paying attention
to your own thoughts or when you're externally referenced? When you are
learning it may be useful to pay attention in both ways at different
points in your learning. At a practical level, you may need to decide
when you want multisensory material and when you may need internal
thinking time to get away from colour, noise, touch, taste, smells.

I still remember the first accelerated learning 'Train the Trainer'
programme I went on. I'd been totally attentive all day with my senses
assailed with colours, noises, movement, emotions; even tastes and
smells because we did a wonderful visualization of a lemon that had us
salivating, even though there were no lemons! By the end of the day I
was overwhelmed and had to go to the swimming pool and deprive myself of
sensory stimulation. I needed to focus and pay attention to what was
going on internally and reduce the distraction from external stimuli. As
my head sank under the water, I closed my eyes and floated, exquisitely
attentive to what was happening in my brain, and so pleased to have a
rest from all the external stimuli.

This is one of the biggest challenges to trainers and designers who
think they have to provide input all the time -- let people pay
attention to what's going on inside their heads as well as outside.

Make things more multisensory when you want people focused on the
outside world, perhaps their learning materials, a quick video or the
discussions, but reduce the multisensory input when you want them to
reflect or process internally.

### Get people into flow and help time to fly {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h3_005 .head-b}

We can't talk about attention and focus and not think about the concept
of *flow*, which is a concept from positive psychology described and
investigated by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (2008). It's the idea of being
completely immersed and fully focused on something; you have an
energized focus and complete involvement in an activity. Sometimes
people talk about feeling joyful or energized when they are in flow, but
sometimes you're not []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_120 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 120" role="doc-pagebreak"}consciously aware of your
feelings at all because you're so focused on the activity. Time often
flies by without you noticing and it's intrinsically rewarding. It's
essentially a great place to be for a while, though people in flow don't
always pay attention to others or to their own bodily needs like eating,
drinking or sleeping.

Csikszentmihalyi's theory suggests three things need to be in place to
achieve flow so it's worth thinking about how you can create these
conditions for yourself and your learners.

You need a task or activity with clear goals and progress, clear and
immediate feedback so you can adjust your performance to maintain the
flow state and the right balance between the perceived challenges of the
task and your perceived skills. You need to be confident you can
complete the task but it needs to be complex enough to be challenging.

The enemy of flow is apathy or boredom. In fact I'd argue boredom is the
enemy of most learning, though there is some evidence that being bored
can lead to creative thinking (Rhodes, 2015).

### Increase levels of self-reference {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h3_006 .head-b}

It seems common sense that we pay attention to things when they refer to
us but it's one common sense idea that is backed up by evidence. A
meta-study of the research at the University of Connecticut in 1997
concludes that people pay more attention to and remember information
more easily if they are able to relate it to themselves, potentially
because it creates more elaborate processing of information (Symons and
Johnson, 1997).

Our own feelings of self and conscious awareness are incredibly complex
and the study of consciousness uncovers new ideas every day. We're not
going to start unpicking that here because otherwise you'll end up in
deep philosophical conversations about what is self and what is
consciousness and if Anil Seth, co-director of the Sackler Centre for
Consciousness Science, can't explain it quickly then I certainly can't.

If you're looking for the biological location though, the sense of self
seems to cause activation in various cortical structures. This includes
the medial prefrontal cortex, the prefrontal cortex and activity has
also been measured in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex when subjects
were asked to encode self-referential material. Other studies have shown
that an area of the visual cortex, the extrastriate body, seems to be
important in recognizing parts of our bodies as belonging to us.

[]{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_121 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 121"
role="doc-pagebreak"}What can you do as a trainer to create a strong
self-reference for people? Some of these things are simple and you
probably include many of them in your design and delivery already; at
least now you know it's backed up by research:

- Use people's names regularly to build rapport; it's even easier in
  digital learning because names are usually visible.

- Use people's names when you ask questions to boost attention.

- Ask people what their reflections are on what they just learnt.

- Ask them how they'll use the material later.

- Promote the chat function so people express opinions regularly and
  engage with it

- Tell stories that are specific to their business, their organization,
  their situations, or ask people to tell their own stories.

- Adapt exercises and case studies so they fit with their own
  experiences.

- Use the word 'you' far more than 'I'. Instead of 'I need you to
  complete this exercise' write 'You need to complete this exercise'.

- Write instructions in direct rather than indirect speech: 'When you've
  finished reading the text, answer the questions...'

Even talking about people's relations has been shown to have an effect
on self-reference and memory, so those discussions in the coffee breaks
where you find out about people and can refer back to friends or family
are important for attention.

One activity that a client did to increase attention through
self-reference was to hand the mouse to his audience instead of keeping
it to himself. The 'users' became far more alert, plus chose when they
wanted to move on and what they were focusing on.

### Increase levels of exercise {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h3_007 .head-b}

John Medina in his book *Brain Rules* (2008) makes exercise his number
one Brain Rule, and if you haven't read somewhere that exercise is going
to keep your brain going, increase your life span or do something
amazing for you, I'll be very surprised. More and more evidence shows
that exercise is good for us and sitting down is bad and it doesn't all
have to be about donning running shoes and taking serious exercise.

[]{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_122 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 122"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Students asked to read e-mails and text while
walking at 2.25 km/h at a treadmill desk improved their memory for the
material and also said they felt they were able to concentrate better
during the 40-minute reading task (Labonté-LeMoyne et al, 2015). Their
brainwaves were also measured using EEG and showed signs of lower theta
frequency and higher alpha frequencies, which the researchers
interpreted as superior mental functioning. Researchers have found that
students who engaged in moderate physical exercise before taking a test
that measured attention spans performed better than students who didn't
exercise. The researchers found that exercise primarily helps our
brain's ability to ignore distractions, although they weren't exactly
sure why.

So, instead of asking people to sit down during any form of study, why
not encourage them to move or at the very least stand up.

As anecdotal evidence I regularly encourage people to stand up to view,
discuss or share information and I believe the quality and quantity of
questions that people ask are far superior to when they are sitting
down.

We've done this even more since an incident where I was talking to a
group about the neuroscience of memory. They all seemed interested and
engaged; certainly everyone looked alert and as if they were paying
attention. One colleague, Carole Elam, came in late and indicated she
was going to grab a coffee before she sat down. She busied herself at
the back of the room getting coffee and didn't appear to be
concentrating on what I was saying. And then she sat down and 'paid
attention'. Later that day, as part of the session, we did a test as to
what people had remembered. Carole came up to me and explained she'd
done better in the test for the section while she'd been making coffee
than when she'd sat down. Her experience was that while she was making
coffee she'd felt physically and mentally alert and needed to
concentrate in case she missed anything, but as she sat down she felt
herself slip into 'sponge mode'. Of course, we can't measure what it was
about the experience that actually increased her attention but we both
believe a strong factor was because she was moving rather than sitting.

Coffee helps maintain attention levels too, so don't forget that when
you're training.

### Questions as a powerful tool for directing attention {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h3_008 .head-b}

I'm sure you already use questions when you're designing or facilitating
learning but I want you to think about them as additional attention
grabbers:

- []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_123 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 123"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}They increase self-reference, particularly if you
  use someone's name.

- People have to search in their heads for the answer to a question so
  they have to recall rather than just encode information.

- They tend to promote eustress; when you're asked questions you tend to
  be more alert than if you're simply listening or clicking.

- Asking 'why' you might use a particular technique requires more
  thinking than asking 'what it is' because you increase the processing
  from structural to semantic.

- Scenario-based questions need deeper processing than multiple-choice
  questions with straightforward answers.

Additionally, questions can strongly influence where we place our
attention. Answer the following questions.

Have you got a pet? Do you know anyone with a pet? What is it about pets
that you like or dislike?

Before I asked those questions I don't suppose you were thinking about
animals, were you? But merely by posing the question, your brain goes
off to find answers.

You can quickly direct people's attention to something specific by
asking a question, which is possibly why so many speakers and orators
start with a rhetorical question to grab your attention.

A lot of digital learning tends to deliver information rather than
prompt the user to think before revealing the information, which may
partially explain why people often get distracted or don't complete
digital learning. How can you use the previous techniques to grab more
digital attention?

## [Paralysis by presentation](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_07_CHAP_C07_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h2_006 .head-a}

We've talked about exercise and some of the other things that promote
attention, so here's a story about a different scenario for you to
consider.

Are you a hypnotist? You may not know it yet, but you probably have been
-- and you probably did it while you were training. I hope you find this
story of a coincidence enlightening.

I once had the opportunity to participate in a group hypnosis session. I
know I'm not particularly susceptible to hypnosis, but after 20 minutes
we were given a suggestion that we couldn't move our arms. I wanted to
prove I wasn't hypnotized. I knew I could move if I really wanted to,
but I just []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_124 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 124" role="doc-pagebreak"}couldn't drum up the energy
to move; it was too comfortable lying there still. I was effectively
paralysed. This is apparently quite a normal experience of hypnosis and
rather enjoyable.

A few days later, I found myself behaving in the same way but this time
I hadn't willingly or knowingly been hypnotized -- and it wasn't the
intention of the 'hypnotist' either. In a seminar one morning the room
was comfortably warm, the seats were soft and deep, the lights were
dimmed for the slides and the presenter was familiar with his material.

After about 30 minutes of talking it was time for the 'interactive part'
and he asked for questions. Nobody moved, nobody volunteered, so the
facilitator posed some questions to the 'expert panel'. One of them made
an interesting point to which I wanted to respond, but I couldn't rouse
myself to say or do anything. I recognized it was the same mental and
physical paralysis as the hypnosis. The conditions for many meetings and
training sessions are similar to those deliberately chosen for the
hypnosis session -- muted lighting, comfortable warm surroundings,
everyone sitting still and someone talking to us.

Reflect honestly now -- how often do you find your participants are slow
to actively participate or ask questions at the end of a session? Do you
ever find that people say they are interested in your ideas before a
session but then it's hard to get them to respond once you've started?
Or have you told a group that you'd like this to be interactive and to
ask questions and then felt frustrated when nobody asks any? Have you
accidentally put them in a hypnotic state?

In a hypnotic state we absorb information effectively but a key feature
of hypnosis is your critical faculties are turned off. You stop
critically evaluating what you see, hear or feel and become suggestible.
I invite you to consider what state people are in when you present
information to them. Perhaps they are literally in no fit state to
critically evaluate the information they've been given and respond. They
can only do that when they've been reawakened by walking back to the
office -- by which time it may be too late.

When you need people to actively absorb and learn something,
particularly if you want them to consider it, challenge it or engage
with it, presenting it through the power of hypnosis is not the most
effective way of doing it. But if you want to drip-feed information
non-critically with a view to shifting mindsets, perhaps to boost
creativity or confidence, by all means use a guided visualization.

## []{#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml_page_125 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 125" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Summary](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_07_CHAP_C07_h2_007){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml__07_CHAP_C07_h2_007 .head-a}

People learn better when they pay attention to what they are learning.
Without attention, information will not be encoded into memory (more of
that in another chapter). To increase attention levels:

- Find the Goldilocks level of arousal -- just the right amount of
  eustress.

- Increase the complexity of processing.

- Decrease the amount of multitasking you ask people to do.

- Decide whether multisensory input is helping or hindering.

- Get people into flow and help time to fly.

- Get people to feel it's personal by increasing the levels of
  self-reference.

- Stand up, walk around, encourage movement.

- Create more complex digital interactions; e.g. sorting rather than
  clicking, scenario-based questions.

- Direct attention to what's important -- questions are an easy way to
  do this.

- Don't hypnotize people.

e^i*π*^ + 1 = 0

How beautiful do you find this equation?

Apparently it's called Leonhard Euler's identity and mathematicians find
it beautiful (Zeki et al, 2014). Whereas the equation below is
considered ugly, sadly for Srinivasa Ramanujan, who derived it:

<figure id="_08_CHAP_C08_UFigure_8_1" class="figure">
<p><img src="content/images/M08EQ001.png"
alt="1 over pi equals 2 times square root of 2 over 9801 sum starting k equals zero to infinity left parenthesis 4 k right parenthesis factorial of left parenthesis 1 1 0 3 plus 2 6 3 9 0 k right parenthesis over left parenthesis k factorial right parenthesis to the fourth power times 396 to the 4 k power" /></p>
</figure>

It turns out that non-mathematicians who don't understand these
equations, me included, *and* mathematicians all show similar reactions
in a particular part of the medial orbitoprefrontal cortex when making
judgements about beauty -- even the beauty of equations. On the other
hand, when you're actually looking at and processing numbers, a
different area of your cortex, the inferior temporal gyrus, which is
known to be involved in the processing of visual information, seems to
be particularly and specifically active. Yet this area isn't activated
when you look at numbers that are written as words, e.g. 'one', 'two'.

Processing numbers isn't something that is hard-wired into your brain.
You're not born with a number recognition neuron (or set of neurons).
It's []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_128 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 128"
role="doc-pagebreak"}something that you learn, and you learn to use
parts of your brain that were originally designed for something else.
It's as if you develop a mathematical skill on the back of some other
processing you do more naturally, and yet some people seem to have a
real strength for maths and some of us don't. Many of us feel
mathematicians are very intelligent, but if they are just hijacking a
part of the brain that normally does something else, is there anything
especially intelligent about them?

Have you ever, as a trainer, educator or learning facilitator had a
disruptive element in your learning environment -- someone who doesn't
seem to want to pay attention, doesn't get it or just generally seems
out to cause trouble? On 'Train the Trainer' workshops we're regularly
asked the question 'How do I deal with difficult delegates?'. And our
response is usually that we don't believe there is such a thing as a
difficult delegate, but that some people may not yet have found the best
way to process the information or skills that they're learning. Your job
as a facilitator of learning is to help them explore and find their
optimum way through the information. There may be 1,001 reasons why
someone might be disruptive but perhaps they just don't quite get
learning in the way that it's being offered to them.

Have you ever seen the film *The Full Monty*? There's a lovely moment in
it to demonstrate a group of people being taught something they just
don't get until they translate it into something meaningful for them.
Gerald, the ex-foreman of a group of ex-steelworkers, is teaching them
to dance like the Chippendales (a dancing group famous for taking their
clothes off as part of their routine). Gerald knows the dance steps, and
is used to being boss, so he explains and demonstrates the steps but
none of the guys are able to do it. To them it makes no sense and has no
meaning for them. They can hear what he's saying, they can see what he's
showing them, they're even able to put one foot in front of the other
when he tells them to, but they're still not able to make real sense of
what they're learning and apply it. They can't dance, and certainly not
how Gerald wants! Then one of them, called Horse, relates it to
something else he already knows and shouts out 'It's the Arsenal offside
trap isn't it. Why didn't you say that before?' and suddenly they're all
dancing! They've found something meaningful to them that makes sense of
the new information so they can express it and use it.

[]{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_129 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 129"
role="doc-pagebreak"}All of us need to make sense of things to help us
learn. In this chapter (see [Figure
8.1](#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_Figure_8_1)) you'll explore
multiple different ways of processing and making sense of information
and you'll find some ideas to help you recognize that perhaps you
haven't got difficult delegates at all -- just people who may want to
process information differently or a task that is better suited to
another mode of delivery.

## [Intelligence and learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_08_CHAP_C08_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h2_003 .head-a}

There's a real-world challenge to learning related to the concept of
intelligence. People are generally considered 'intelligent' if they have
a high IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and children and adults are graded and
assessed depending on this measure of intelligence that is now more than
100 years old. People with a high IQ often do well at school and
academically, given the right circumstances, but there is an anomaly in
that the people who do well academically aren't always the most
successful in other areas at school, at work or in life generally. And
the people who are successful in other ways aren't always formally
recognized as intelligent or academic, but they seem able to learn what
they need without getting good grades.

When you were at school you may have known children who were deemed to
be 'intelligent' -- they usually got top marks in academic subjects like
maths, science, English or history. There were other children who
excelled at sport, art, music, dancing or maybe making friends but they
weren't always classified as 'intelligent' by the standard measures,
despite the fact they clearly had strong abilities in certain areas and
that these activities all require complex cognitive processing. You
yourself may fit into one of these characterizations. IQ tests, a
commonly accepted measure of 'intelligence', measure your verbal skills,
mathematical and logical reasoning skills, and an element of spatial
awareness, but there are many things that IQ tests don't measure
adequately or at all.

Consider people like Neil Baldwin from Stoke-on-Trent, England who is
registered as learning disabled and yet has had an amazing life which
was documented in the film *Marvellous*. He has an honorary degree from
Keele University which he was awarded because:

> He has watched, supported and kept in touch with successive cohorts of
> Keele students building an impressive network of alumni contacts both
> national and []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_131 .pagebreak
> aria-label="Page 131" role="doc-pagebreak"}internationally. He serves
> the students offering advice and support to students, remaining
> steadfastly proud and loyal to Keele
>
> (Wikipedia, 2015)

He counts an Archbishop of Canterbury among his friends and once even
played for Stoke City Football Club as well as being their kit man for
many years. Neil Baldwin has achieved success in numerous fields and has
certainly learnt and adapted throughout his life despite, and possibly
even because of, his learning disabilities.

Learning is about far more than just taking information in and
remembering it -- once you've successfully absorbed information through
your senses and it's in your head, you have to make sense of it to
understand it, and ultimately remember and use it.

### Expanding the scope of intelligence to make more sense of learning {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_001 .head-b}

Howard Gardner from Harvard University introduced the concept of
Multiple Intelligences back in 1983 with the publication of a book of
that name. He poses the idea that people are intelligent even if they
are not academic, and has identified eight major intelligences.

Daniel Goleman coined the phrase Emotional Intelligence with the
publication of his book in 1996, whereby he argued that people with a
high level of emotional intelligence are more successful in life than
those with a high IQ.

Even before that came the concept of Social Intelligence in the 1930s.
So what's important about all these different types of intelligence?

Success doesn't seem to be down solely to IQ -- there are many
successful people in the world who do not have a particularly high IQ,
but still blossom in their chosen field.

Who can you think of that is an 'expert' or excels in a particular field
but you wouldn't necessarily class as traditionally intelligent? What
areas of expertise are you good at and enjoy and yet you don't
necessarily have an academic qualification for?

### Multiple Intelligence isn't Learning Styles either {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_002 .head-b}

Before we go any further, I just want you to be clear that Multiple
Intelligence Theory is not the same as Learning Styles. Learning Styles
have been largely discounted as having any scientific validity and
there's an excellent analysis of why they are not the same by Howard
Gardner himself in the []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_132 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 132" role="doc-pagebreak"}*Washington Post* 2013
(Strauss, 2013). Learning Styles implies that people have a particular
style they favour over others and that it's applicable across a wide
range of activities, whereas Multiple Intelligence theory suggests that
people may have strengths in certain areas and that certain activities
might be more appropriate to learning different things. Gardner's
suggestions are to:

- Individualize or personalize where possible

- '\[T\]each important materials in several ways, not just one'

- Drop the term Learning Styles.

### The Multiple Intelligence Theory in learning {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_003 .head-b}

Howard Gardner came from an investigative, scientific background and
studied neurophysiology and neuropsychology as well as working with
people who had various types of brain damage. He came to recognize that
all abilities require complex cognitive processes beyond those measured
by IQ tests. He originally defined an intelligence as 'the ability to
solve problems or create products that are valued within one or more
cultural settings' and after 20 years has refined this to 'a
biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated
in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of
value in a culture'.

He has proposed eight criteria to decide whether something is an
intelligence and has identified eight intelligences that he believes
meet the following criteria:

1.  Potential of isolation by brain damage

2.  Evolutionary history and evolutionary plausibility

3.  Identifiable core operation or set of operations

4.  Susceptibility to encoding in a symbol system

5.  Distinct developmental history with defined set of expert
    'end-state' performances

6.  Existence of savants, prodigies and other exceptional people

7.  Support from experimental psychological tasks

8.  Support from psychometric findings.

Many intelligences have been suggested but dismissed. Gardner has
specifically considered the concept of a 'spiritual' intelligence, but
for now errs on the side of caution and does not believe it fully meets
his own criteria for classification as an intelligence.

[]{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_133 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 133"
role="doc-pagebreak"}While Gardner's intelligences do not have direct
physiological counterparts, i.e. you can't exactly map them to specific
regions of the brain, these criteria do provide a means of categorizing
different skills and activities and are certainly useful in helping to
design learning interventions that meet the needs of a wider group of
people. As more is revealed about the specific neurobiology of the brain
there will be some things that map well onto Gardner's theory and others
that may throw doubts upon it. Gardner himself, like most good
scientists, adapts his work in the light of new evidence.

So how does this matter for you, either as a learner yourself or as
someone working with people and helping them to learn? How can you apply
this knowledge to help people process information and make it meaningful
using their own strengths and how can you use the breadth of your
intelligences? You're going to see that Gardner's intelligences can be a
pragmatic way to think about how you learn and how you can adapt your
learning designs to meet more needs. Gardner's intelligences theory is
already adopted across the world in many educational curricula and at
the very prestigious Wellington College in Berkshire they think the
intelligences are so important they've had them physically built into
their environment.

First of all, let's find out what Gardner classifies as intelligences
and some quick ideas about how you could use them. You'll read briefly
about how some parts of the brain process different sorts of information
but remember there is, as yet, no evidence for a full physiological
description of the multiple intelligences -- and certainly not a
physiological test.

### Multiple Intelligences in action {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_004 .head-b}

#### Linguistic {.head-c}

The skill with words, used by writers, advocates, story-tellers, poets.
You can explore this intelligence by writing or recording all the key
points. Write a letter to a friend or a fictitious newspaper article.
Develop a written learning summary. Create word searches or crossword
puzzles for learners to explore. Language is processed mainly in the
left cortex and damage to either of the two main areas, Broca's and
Wernicke's, can create unusual effects such as fluent speech with no
apparent sense or comprehension or the inability to speak while
comprehension remains intact. Reading and writing use language
processing brain areas with additional visual and motor cortex
activation.

#### []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_134 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 134" role="doc-pagebreak"}Logical--mathematical {.head-c}

The skill of analysis and logic is used by scientists, economists,
statisticians, mathematicians.

You can explore this intelligence by sharing flow charts or
infographics, asking learners to list main points in a logical, numbered
sequence. You can use this logical framework to discuss an idea. Prompt
them with the following (AEIOU) questions -- what Assumptions; what
Evidence; is there a good Illustration of this; what are my
Observations; what are the Unique points? The left side of the brain has
long been associated with logical thinking and there is some evidence
that it may also be more optimistic -- better able to work things out to
a logical conclusion than 'awfulize'. Neurons on the left side are more
densely packed, which may be one reason why the left brain is better at
processing detail.

#### Visual--spatial {.head-c}

The ability to visualize and create pictures in your mind's eye is used
by architects, navigators, designers, artists, photographers. You can
support learning by creating a learning map, a poster, a cartoon, a
video or a visual timeline. Use colour, symbols, linkages, texture and
white space.

The visual cortex has enormous processing power and is split into
different areas, each responsible for a different quality of visual
perception, e.g. scanning, motion, colour, etc. Finding your way around
in space calls for right-brained activity in the hippocampus and
parietal cortex.

#### Body/Physical {.head-c}

Using your body skilfully is demonstrated by surgeons, athletes, dancers
and craftspeople. You can explore this intelligence by writing, circling
or ticking words, building something, sorting flash cards, moving around
while talking out loud, role-playing or perhaps designing a jigsaw. Just
don't sit still!

The primary motor cortex, just about in the middle of your head, sends
and receives messages from your muscles to coordinate them. You're also
using the cerebellum for balance and coordination and the basal ganglia
play a part in learning repeated actions and habits.

#### Musical {.head-c}

The skill of creating or identifying complex sound/rhythmic patterns is
used by musicians, composers, sound engineers, piano tuners and DJs. To
explore this intelligence you could redevelop a jingle, advert, song,
rap, rhyme or []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_135 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 135" role="doc-pagebreak"}poem, with the key points
from your learning or even invent some verses of your own!

Musicians have been found to have, on average, 25 per cent more of the
right auditory cortex given over to musical processing. This is
particularly strong for people who start to play early in life.

#### Interpersonal {.head-c}

This is the ability to communicate well or be empathetic and is
demonstrated by trainers, counsellors, salespeople, social workers. You
can explore this by setting up learning circles or discussion groups or
embracing the use of social media and digital collaboration tools. You
could also get a mentor, co-coach a friend or colleague or find a study
buddy. Make sure you collaborate with others rather than compete.

Working effectively with people calls on many parts of the brain in an
emotion network.

#### Intrapersonal {.head-c}

This is the ability to be reflective or at peace with oneself, as
practised by Buddhists, diarists, philosophers and life strategists. To
explore this you can ask yourself -- how can I use this idea/what is its
significance to me? Keep a diary or a learning log or produce a personal
timeline. Think an idea through before sharing.

Self-awareness is a complex activity, but one area that has been
associated with focusing on internal stimuli is the anterior cingulate
cortex in the fissure between the two hemispheres. Areas of the
prefrontal cortex are responsible for complex cognitive activities like
planning and decision-making.

#### Naturalist {.head-c}

This is the ability to recognize and classify the numerous species of an
environment. It is demonstrated by naturalists, gardeners,
environmentalists, and perhaps even collectors of cars, ornaments, sound
systems. This intelligence can be explored by sorting items into
categories, creating subsets of different categories, looking for
details that make things similar or dissimilar or by searching for
environmental implications.

Categorizing and recognition of objects is an activity that seems to
take place between the relevant sensory cortex and an 'association' area
that is next to it. Memory is important for this task, as is emotion.
Single brain []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_136 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 136" role="doc-pagebreak"}lesions can erase all
knowledge of a particular object and there are different parts of the
brain for identifying man-made and natural objects and even
discriminating between familiar and unfamiliar faces.

### Measuring the Intelligences {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_005 .head-b}

While IQ can be measured using paper-based or online tests it becomes
much harder to assess the Multiple Intelligences. Gardner himself
suggests that there isn't an easy way to assess them because the tests
in themselves are usually inherently skewed towards those with a
linguistic or logical--mathematical strength. He believes in observing
people to see where they excel and therefore demonstrate their
abilities.

And there are so many processes involved in any one skill that even that
becomes problematic.

Whether the intelligences exist as physical entities or as psychological
concepts there seem to be differences in the relative strengths for
different people. Some people have real areas of expertise while being
weaker in others; some have a broad spread. While it is not useful, or
even possible, to categorize people as having a particular intelligence,
it is useful to acknowledge there are differences and to help them
approach learning using different strategies.

### Criticism of Multiple Intelligences {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_006 .head-b}

There are critics of this approach and you can read some of the
criticisms and rebuttals online or in a helpful chapter in the book
*Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom* by Thomas Armstrong (2009) or
Luc Rousseau's article on 'Neuromyths and MI theory' (2020).

A major criticism of Gardner's work is that it is self-referential -- an
intelligence cannot be classified as such unless it meets his criteria
and it cannot be tested because the tests themselves are not 'multiply
intelligent'.

MI theory isn't fully mapped or fully correlated with precise areas of
the brain, i.e. you don't have a 'musical intelligence' area in your
brain despite having particular brain areas that process music. This is
because these concepts are broadly defined and include diffuse skills
and our brain processes are too complex for such a simplistic mapping.
However, there does seem to be some evidence that each intelligence
possesses 'neural coherence that is clear, distinct and aligned with
accepted cognitive-neural correlates' (Shearer and Karanian, 2017).

[]{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_137 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 137"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Some of the criticisms come because of the way
science unfolds and because it's not always easy to do hard science in
the real world. Businesses and organizations don't have resources to run
double-blind trials of training methods; schools need to be careful
about risking children's education just to see if one particular
methodology is better than another. We do need evidence to assess what
does and doesn't work, but sometimes we have to adopt a more realistic
approach.

Speaking as a pragmatist, Multiple Intelligences have been adopted by
many learning professionals across the world who find they offer a
helpful framework for designing more diverse and creative learning
strategies and there is currently enough useful corroboratory evidence
for me to use it until something better comes along.

### Takeaways {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_007 .head-b}

#### Seeing learners differently {.head-c}

When I saw Howard Gardner speak a few years ago he referred to an
interview with Wayne Rooney, who was describing how he played football.
Gardner explained how Rooney needed a different type of processing to
kick the ball to someone who was writing a professorial paper about
football -- and in the appropriate context, Rooney was more intelligent.
Some of what Wayne Rooney did was complex mathematical processing, but
he couldn't 'explain' it in a traditionally intelligent way -- i.e. he
couldn't wax lyrical and write a professorial paper on it, but on the
other hand most of the academically intelligent professors probably
couldn't do the unconscious mathematical reasoning that Wayne Rooney
does to kick a ball accurately.

Could it mean that it would be easier to help Wayne Rooney learn formal
maths if you did it through the medium of football rather than talking
and writing? I don't know the answer to that question, but there is
evidence that people can apply complex mathematics because they use it
in the real world without actually being able to talk about it in an
abstract way. Street children in South America are particularly good at
the sort of applied mathematics that allows them to calculate change,
percentage discounts and their profit and loss on the day, while
struggling in the classroom to do formal mathematics (Saxe, 1988; Pluck,
2015). Which of those activities is going to be of more use to them in
the real world?

### []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_138 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 138" role="doc-pagebreak"}Flexible brains {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_008 .head-b}

Biologically, scientists can see that different people have developed
their brains differently and this affects how they process their worlds.
Remember the London taxi drivers who were found to have a larger
hippocampus when compared with bus drivers? It is hypothesized that
their complex driving experience had developed their hippocampus,
partially responsible for spatial awareness, as compared to bus drivers
who followed a prescribed route. More recent research on these same
drivers shows that it was only the part of their hippocampus that deals
with visuospatial memory that was enlarged and other areas may actually
have become relatively smaller. The author of the original research also
wants to see what happens when the taxi drivers eventually retire but it
appears she's being thwarted because most of them seem to be continuing
to work to a ripe old age.

The interesting thing about the concept of multiple intelligences is
that it is fluid; you can develop your intelligences by exercising them
which fits much more easily into our knowledge about neuroplasticity
than the concepts of a fixed IQ.

### Growth and grit {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_009 .head-b}

Research by Carol Dweck (Dweck, 2007) at Stanford University builds on
the ideas of neuroplasticity and changing brains and suggests that you
can learn better by adopting a Growth mindset. When students see
intelligence as malleable and not fixed, they react to adversity by
working harder and trying out new strategies. This ability to persevere
is popularly referred to as grit.

These two non-cognitive skills, more associated with emotional
intelligence, may have at least equally important bearing on learning
than cognitive skills traditionally associated with success and
intelligence. It seems that both grit and growth mindset activate
connections between prefrontal networks that are associated with
behavioural control and thoughts related to growth mindset provoke
activity in the error monitoring areas, such as the dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex. Behaviours and thoughts associated with grit act more
in the ventrostriatal network that supports perseverance, and the delay
and receipt of reward (Myers et al, 2016). Dopamine and serotonin are
important neurotransmitters linked to grit and growth mindset, providing
both reward and the ability to keep going.

[]{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_139 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 139"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Educators can have an effect by giving praise or
feedback that avoids comments on innate ability and focuses on how
people have performed and what they can do to improve. Telling children
they've worked hard at something seems to improve their performance more
than telling them they are clever at something because this is something
they can repeat easily. If they believe they are already smart or stupid
they are more inclined to either rest on their laurels or fail to try.
Grit and growth mindset are easier to teach and develop than
'cleverness'.

It's worth researching the work of Carol Dweck and particularly some of
the very simple 'tools' she shares about promoting a growth mindset
(Dweck, 2007). The simplest one of all is the power of 'yet'. She worked
in a school where students were graded as having 'passed' or 'not passed
yet' and the results in the school consistently improved. Children began
to realize that learning was not a one-off event in which you succeed or
fail, but a journey that is made more effective when you persist at the
learning process. Many organizations would do well to create this kind
of learning culture where people associate learning with a continuous
process rather than tick-box compliance activities, stressful exams or
one-off 'magic wand' training events that will change behaviours
overnight.

Since the first excitement over growth mindset there have been some
challenges to Dweck's research, suggesting that the results are not
highly replicable and that the research is over-applied. This is a
common challenge for psychological research and one reason scientists
recommend meta­studies, which bring together multiple studies rather than
focus on a few eye-catching results.

### Teach your learners how to learn {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_010 .head-b}

As well as designing training that adopts a multiply intelligent
approach, you might find it useful to teach the multiple intelligences
to your students and participants so they recognize there are multiple
ways to tackle learning new skills and that by trying new and different
ways of learning they can develop their overall intelligence. In a 2007
study of adolescents, it was found that understanding about concepts
such as neuroplasticity improved both self-concept and achievement.

I have a friend whose son would have been top of his class at school if
social skills were taught, and assessed appropriately He left school
with few 'good' qualifications -- does that make him less intelligent?
If you met him []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_140 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 140" role="doc-pagebreak"}you'd know he is bright. When
he needs to learn something that relates to people he's a fast and
effective learner. Helping him see that he's intelligent despite what
his exam marks are saying gave him the confidence to continue what he's
good at and to build on his strengths. (Since the first edition of this
book, this young man progressed quickly through an apprenticeship
scheme, onto a more responsible role and now works as a competent
consultant for a business in London and is studying for a business
qualification for which he's self-motivated. His own confidence, social
skills and growth mindset got him much further than any number of what
he saw as irrelevant qualifications.)

As we uncover more about the neuroscience of behaviour and see that it's
a complex set of cognitive processes, perhaps we'll stop talking about
'soft skills' and instead talk about valuable intelligences that can be
taught at and beyond school. The challenge may be in assessing them and
measuring in a way that the current education system, with an emphasis
on tests that are inherently skewed towards a subset of intelligences,
may not be set up to handle yet. (See [Chapter 14](#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml)
for more on learning to learn.)

### Use Multiple Intelligences as a framework to notice, adapt and improve what you do {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_011 .head-b}

The main benefit of the theory and practice of multiple intelligences is
that you can move away from a more academic and sedentary method of
training, teaching and learning and move into more meaningful learning
experiences that people relate to readily and are more relevant to the
actual knowledge or skills they are learning. Our experience is this
significantly reduces levels of boredom, disruption and concern among
learners as soon as they realize that they aren't going to have to sit
in a formal learning environment doing the same thing all day long. Once
they realize they have multiple different ways to encounter, manipulate
and think about information and practise skills they become engaged and
participate more fully. It rarely happens, but if someone does seem to
be distracted or disruptive you've also got a useful framework to
reflect on what might be happening for them and to devise alternative
strategies. Perhaps they have a strong intrapersonal intelligence and
haven't had sufficient time for reflection or a strong body physical
intelligence and haven't been able to move for ages and exercise their
own particular skills. Think how great you feel when you've been able to
do something you're good at -- you feel valued and valuable. Give your
learners that opportunity as often as you can.

### []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_141 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 141" role="doc-pagebreak"}Work with and against your preferences {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h3_012 .head-b}

As you'll know if you work with any psychometric tools, when people have
different preferences or strengths to you it can be more challenging to
work with them or to work like them. It's similar with intelligences;
you'll have exercises, routines, tools and techniques you've been using
for years and they work well for you. But are they always working as
effectively for your learners? If you have a strong linguistic
preference, perhaps you liked English or languages at school, you write
a blog, you enjoy reading, then you may be offering these delightful
experiences to your learners. I know I have a terrible tendency to offer
everyone a book as soon as they say they're interested in something --
'Oh I know just the book that you'll enjoy' say my linguistic,
interpersonal preferences as I leap across to my bookshelf and thrust a
book at them, thanks to a body physical intelligence that kicks in. I
see them wince slightly and then remember, 'Oh no, not everybody likes
books. What would suit this person more?'

Try to design exploratory learning activities that suit multiple
intelligences, or in the course of a learning session vary the
activities so that you're meeting different intelligences at different
times. Explain to people they'll find some activities really suit them
and others they'll find more challenging but they'll possibly find their
colleagues excel in them. Some topics, information or skills lend
themselves more naturally to particular intelligences. If you're
teaching football, it makes more sense to get out and kick a football,
but for some learners they'll also benefit if you give them some theory
to back up what they're trying on the field or perhaps they'll get
better understanding if they have time to talk it through once they've
practised. Just because you've only ever seen Excel spreadsheets trained
by sitting someone at a computer and logically talking them through the
functions doesn't mean that's the only way to do it. Harnessing the
multiple intelligences can increase your creative design capabilities
enormously.

## [Summary](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_08_CHAP_C08_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml__08_CHAP_C08_h2_004 .head-a}

Here are the highlights from this chapter:

- People need to make sense of the information that enters their heads.
  It seems that different people process information differently based
  upon their natural tendencies, their experiences and the information
  itself.

- []{#08_CHAP_C08.xhtml_page_142 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 142"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Harness the Multiple Intelligences to increase
  your design and delivery skills.

- Working with people's preferences makes them feel more valued and they
  engage more.

- Howard Gardner proposes eight intelligences:

  1.  Linguistic

  2.  Logical--mathematical

  3.  Visual--spatial

  4.  Body/physical

  5.  Musical

  6.  Interpersonal

  7.  Intrapersonal

  8.  Naturalist

- Use these intelligences to adapt what you do to appeal to more people
  and allow them to harness their natural strengths in learning.

- Increase your own creative design and delivery skills by adopting
  multiple intelligences as a framework to make sense of learning.

- Remember to work outside your own preferences.

Can you imagine what it's like to have been to a place hundreds of times
and yet be utterly convinced you've never been there before, you don't
know any of the people who you're talking to and you're sure you've
never been asked to participate in any kind of memory experiment.

HM is one of the most widely documented people in all of memory
research; pick up any textbook on memory and you'll find him in there.
Since he died, a fascinating book (*Permanent Present Tense*, 2013) was
written about him by Professor Suzanne Corkin, the researcher who spent
much of her life working with him and studying his memory, and who
introduced him by his name at last, Henry Molaison. Henry had his
hippocampus removed when he was in his early twenties as a treatment for
severe epilepsy and it's thanks to him that we know so much about
memory. Because his hippocampus was removed, Henry was unable to create
any new memories and even many of his old ones were destroyed or at
least significantly damaged.

Henry worked with Suzanne and her colleagues for about 30 years,
regularly visiting her laboratory building, working with many people
over and over again, but he was unaware that he had met them before or
been to the laboratory and greeted them anew each time he saw them. But
they were able to establish that, at some unconscious level, part of his
memory was still working because he felt Professor Corkin was somehow
familiar to him and decided that perhaps he'd known her at school. He
was also able to learn skills such as 'mirror writing' without any
awareness that he'd ever done it before; once he'd practised for a week
or so he was surprised at how good he was at something he believed he'd
never done. Professor Corkin []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_145 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 145" role="doc-pagebreak"}also suspected that, like
many of us, he may have had some element of selective memory because he
was pretty good at remembering how many cigarettes he'd smoked.

## [What is memory?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_09_CHAP_C09_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h2_002 .head-a}

Many aspects of memory are still largely a mystery but, as memory is so
vitally important for learning, this is your opportunity to explore some
of those mysteries and, more importantly for you, to see how you can
make sure people have a strong memory of what they learn (see [Figure
9.1](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_Figure_9_1) for an overview of the
chapter). You'll explore different types of memories and triggers for
laying down and later recalling memories. You might find out some things
you didn't know about memory and I hope you will find some ideas to
stimulate your thinking and, perhaps, to change your practices around
learning -- not just in the design and delivery of learning programmes
but also in the wider environment of learning and development.

The key player in this memory game is the hippocampus. If you struggle
to remember the word then imagine a large grey hippo with a pair of red
reading glasses on its head, peering out of a small green camping tent,
laid out on freshly mown grass. The hippo is calling in a squeaky voice,
asking you why it can never remember where it's put its glasses. This is
a silly thing to ask you to remember, but, if you don't already use
silly images to aid your memory, as you read this chapter start to
unpick why silly images conjured up in your head will help you remember
better, and what that might mean for your learners.

[]{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_146 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 146"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Despite the amazing amounts of research, the
process of creating memories is still not clearly understood and there
isn't one unifying theory. To understand a bit more about what happens,
first have a think about several types of memories because they behave a
little bit differently.

## [Types of memories](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_09_CHAP_C09_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h2_003 .head-a}

### Can you talk about what you remember? {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_001 .head-b}

If someone asks you who your prime minister or president is you can
probably tell them. If someone asks you to tell them about your last
holiday you can probably tell them about that too. But if someone asks
you to tell them how to ride a []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_147 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 147" role="doc-pagebreak"}bike or how to read you can
probably start to find words to describe it but it's much harder to
actually tell them about the experience. This is the difference between
two types of memory -- declarative or explicit, and non-declarative or
implicit memory. Declarative (explicit) memories are almost what they
sound like -- you can declare them and talk about them, while
non-declarative (implicit) memories are much more unconscious or
subconscious and are things you've learnt that you find harder to put
into words. These types of implicit and explicit memories are processed
differently in your brain and it's worth thinking about this because it
may alter the way you help people learn if you understand that they are
different things you are trying to do.

Explicit memories split further into semantic memories, those pieces of
information that you just know (for example, the Battle of Hastings was
1066 or that the hippocampus is the seat of memory), as opposed to
episodic memories, which are the memories of specific events, situations
or experiences both autobiographical and general. It's possible you may
remember the exact moment when you learnt the hippocampus is the seat of
memory (episodic) but it's more likely to be just one of those facts you
know (semantic).

### When you can't describe your memory {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_002 .head-b}

Implicit (non-declarative) memories include procedural memories: those
memories of procedures that we do unconsciously and regularly so that
we've effectively forgotten how we ever knew them. We may even find it
hard to think of them as memories as they often just seem like a skill
you've learnt rather than a memory. However, at some point as you learnt
to ride a bike you were encoding and storing the complex skills,
movements and coordination needed to do this. Now when you ride a bike
you pull the memory out of all those different areas even though you're
not aware of it.

## [How you process memories](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_09_CHAP_C09_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h2_004 .head-a}

I've already mentioned that you have declarative and non-declarative
memories so you're going to read about declarative memories in this
chapter and then more about non-declarative memories and habits in the
next one on practice and testing.

Declarative memory processing is recognized to have four stages:
encoding, storage, retrieval and -- equally crucially for learning we
also need to remember -- forgetting. In real life it's nothing like as
well ordered as this, but here goes...

### Encoding {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_003 .head-b}

First of all, you need to receive the information in whatever external
format it arrives in your brain and change it into electrical patterns
for processing. This encoding happens automatically without you
necessarily having to consciously remember, particularly if there are
strong emotional, multisensory, novel and attention-grabbing elements.
An event like the most amazing holiday you ever had just stays with you,
whereas the trip you specifically took to work yesterday as opposed to
any other day is much harder to recall because it doesn't have so many
of those unique elements to it.

Other types of encoding are harder work; trying to remember the six
points of your company mission statement so you can teach it next week
is going to require some serious attention on your part. This is
deliberate encoding and feels more like 'learning' than the other sort
of memory, which feels like 'experiencing'. The amount of attention you
pay to something affects how well you encode it so you probably didn't
pay any attention to your journey to work yesterday because you know the
routine and instead were able to put your attention to the training
about the company mission statement. (You might want to go back to
[Chapter 7](#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml) on attention to refresh this.)

As information comes into your head it spreads out across your brain
into different areas. Some parts of your brain are highly specialized
and only process that sort of information. For instance, as you read
earlier, in your []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_148 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 148" role="doc-pagebreak"}visual cortex there are
individual neurons that only react to information about horizontal
lines, others that are only interested in corners or specific colours.
And yet what we see is a whole picture because somehow our brains put
all the information together to make it seem whole -- this is one of the
big mysteries of memory, called the binding problem, and is going to be
important to remember when you come back to thinking about how you
recall memories. How you encode memories is a big piece of how 'sticky'
your memories become and you'll explore some practical techniques later
in this chapter.

### Working memory through to long-term memory {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_004 .head-b}

One of the destinations of the new information will be your working
memory, which somewhat confusingly used to be called short-term memory.
Working memory is a more realistic description of what is really a
psychological construct, i.e. a model that psychologists use to try to
describe something they don't understand entirely. Structurally, your
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, responsible for executive planning among
other things, is involved. Your dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is
heavily connected to other cortical and subcortical areas including your
hippocampus.

[]{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_149 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 149"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Working memory is a sort of temporary storage area
for information that you use before the journey to long-term memory
begins. It has been extensively studied by Alan Baddeley (2009) of
Bristol University who has a three-part model for how working memory
operates:

1.  The central executive sits in your frontal cortex and coordinates
    the information coming into your brain, focuses your attention, and
    ties it up with retrieval of old memories.

2.  The phonological loop includes Broca's area, a language processing
    area in your left hemisphere, and a phonological stage or inner
    voice sitting in the left temporal lobe. You can hear your
    phonological loop sometimes when you've been immersed in a thought
    and someone interrupts you. You ask them to repeat themselves but as
    they do so you realize that you had heard what they'd said and you
    can replay it before they repeat it. It seems to last for about two
    seconds.

3.  The visuospatial sketch pad holds images in mind and is tucked away
    in your right occipital lobe. This has a much shorter time span than
    the phonological loop.

Working memory lets you hold information in your head for a short time
in order, literally, to work with it; but it's very limited. If I ask
you to count backwards from 100 you can probably start to do it, but if
I ask you to continue to count backwards while recalling the six wives
of Henry VIII you're probably going to fail at one task or another. You
just can't manipulate that much data in your working memory, which is
one of the reasons that multitasking degrades your performance.

### Storage or consolidation {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_005 .head-b}

Useful information coming into your brain needs to be stored somewhere
but it's not quite as easy as saying there is one place where your
memories are stored.

We know the hippocampus is vitally important for memory because it was
Henry Molaison's lack of hippocampus that led to his problems. However,
it seems the hippocampus may be more of an organizer than a warehouse
worker. Your hippocampus doesn't just store information and then go and
get it out when you ask but instead moves memories about to multiple
different places and coordinates a very complex process of sorting,
moving, shuffling, resorting, until such a time as it feels it's got the
best fit. Rather than being stored in the hippocampus, information seems
to be stored in the brain in the relevant areas in which it was
originally processed; visual information is stored in the visual cortex
and auditory information is stored in the auditory cortex. But this
means memories are highly distributed across your brain because, on the
whole, memories include multisensory, emotional and cognitive elements
and this causes neuroscientists a big headache. How can we integrate all
those different factors into one seemingly whole memory? This is
currently one of the major ongoing areas of brain research.

The episodic memories of your life seem to shuttle for a long time
between the hippocampus and your cortex; you store them, retrieve them,
put them back again with a constant exchange of information between the
cortex and hippocampus as you use those memories (Hupbach et al, 2007).
An interesting patient known only as HK seems to be only the second
person reported as having hyperthymesia: an ability to recall almost all
of his autobiographical memories which may be due to a larger amygdala
than normal tagging his memories with rich emotions (Jarrett, 2012;
Ally, Hussey and Donahue, 2013). Occasionally unusual cases are reported
of people who seem to have []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_150 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 150" role="doc-pagebreak"}no significant episodic
memories of their own despite having normal memories for facts and
functioning perfectly adequately (Jarrett, 2015; Palombo et al, 2015).
These people also struggle on visual memory tasks and to imagine future
events which backs up the notion that memory and future imagination
share similar processes. There's even a school of thought that thinks
the main purpose of memory is actually to imagine and plan for the
future, which is a skill that seems rare in the animal world.

Eventually, episodic and semantic memories seem to be lodged in your
cortex which is when a memory is said to be 'consolidated' but it can
take anything from a few weeks to decades. Procedural memories appear to
sit mainly in the cerebellum, implicated in balance and some elements of
motor control, but procedural memories also need the hippocampus to work
hard to organize them and you'll explore that more when you read about
habits.

Over and over again researchers have demonstrated the value of sleep to
performance and learning, but it's sleeping after the encoding that's
important. You don't encode information while you're asleep, but it is
vital for the storage. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine acts like a
switch on your memories: during the day acetylcholine levels in your
hippocampus are relatively high and information is sent from the cortex
to the hippocampus, but when you're asleep the hippocampus starts to
send information back into the cortex -- acetylcholine levels are
correspondingly lower. It may be that during the day the higher
acetylcholine levels partially suppress excitatory feedback connections
which allows you to encode new fresh memories without older ones
interfering. At night there is greater and wider electrical activity in
the hippocampus which may spread back up to the cortex and help your
memories to consolidate. Remember this information about acetylcholine,
because you're going to meet a whole new set of neurotransmitters
relating to sleep and learning in [Chapter 13](#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml).

Consolidation starts within the first few hours of learning but it can
take many years for a memory to be, in any sense of the word, stable,
but as you'll see when you read about retrieval it may be that your
memories are always shifting. Your memories about you, facts, your life,
your experiences are definitely not as solid as you might like to think
they are. Once you start getting your head around memory you may never
again be able to hold a convincing argument about what happened in the
past because you'll see that you're just creating the story afresh each
time.

### []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_151 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 151" role="doc-pagebreak"}Retrieval {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_006 .head-b}

Recall is also complex and isn't simply about finding the memory and
neatly pulling it out. While memories are quite fresh (hours to days)
they are relatively coherent and it's as if you were to retrieve a file
from a newly organized office. You will find it where you put it and all
the pages are there and in the right order. However, quite quickly these
memories 'degrade' and, in the same way that memories were pushed all
over the brain when you encoded them, you now have to retrieve them from
all over the brain.

Memories are easily disrupted and can be distorted even when you think
they are long term and therefore stable. When you remember something
your brain pulls in information from across your brain and effectively
reconstructs the memory afresh. As you retrieve all those pieces and put
them back together again they become labile and unstable and are open to
being affected by new data that comes in or other old memory fragments.
Studies have shown how experimenters can manipulate memories quite
easily and in fact it may be that the process of consolidation happens
all over again -- not surprisingly it's called reconsolidation.

Imagine you recall a bus ride you took last week. You effectively ask
your hippocampus to look for as much information as it can about that
particular instance of the bus ride. Depending on how many buses you
take will affect the sort of information your hippocampus is able to
locate. Now, let's say you sat on the bus next to a lady in a red coat
yesterday but you sat next to a lady in a blue coat the week before. As
you pull in all your memory fragments, the lady in the red coat may have
a stronger memory trace, because it's fresher, than the lady in the blue
coat and that trace might displace the blue coat trace. Having
remembered last week's bus trip you put all the information back again,
possibly while you're asleep and that acetylcholine switch sends the
information from your hippocampus back into your cortex. Next time you
remember last week's trip, the red-coated lady has replaced the
blue-coated lady. This is how you find yourself telling your friend how
odd it is you always seem to sit next to a lady in a red coat. As you
can see it's this kind of memory recall problem which causes difficulty
for police investigations, but perhaps it's also the cause of many
personal disagreements over the years: 'I definitely remember it was a
lady in a red coat I sat next to last week!'

Julia Shaw in her book *The Memory Illusion* (2017) explains some of her
research where she implants false memories so that people believe, for
instance, they had actually shop-lifted when they were young, even when
[]{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_152 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 152"
role="doc-pagebreak"}they hadn't. You'll be glad to know she also helps
them to 'forget' after the experiment. Our ability to create memories
serves us well but can be a disservice too because we can never be sure
they are entirely accurate, however strongly we believe they are. Julia
says, 'We can merely collect independent corroborating evidence that
suggests that a memory is a more or less accurate representation of
something that actually happened.'

One way to try to keep your memories 'fresh' and more representative of
the way they were originally created is to repeat the memory regularly
while it's new and you'll find out more about the importance of review
and repetition to effective learning in [Chapter
11](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml).

### Forgetting {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_007 .head-b}

Surely you don't want to ask learners to forget; your job is to help
them learn and remember. However, forgetting is vitally important to
learning and to mental health. Those people who suffer from
post-traumatic stress syndrome effectively can't forget, and this
impedes their life because they'd like to forget. Research now shows
that it's much harder to suppress or forget memories that are strongly
emotional and this has cast serious doubt on the 'repressed memories'
theory.

It seems forgetting doesn't actually erase the previous memory but
instead creates a novel brain state. Experiments with C. elegans worms
showed that the 'forgotten' state is different to the state before
learning happened and the state while the behaviour is remembered. This
makes it easier to relearn or be reminded of something because the brain
has changed from its initial naïve state. It initially took three to
four hours to train worms to avoid an infectious bacteria but within one
hour they had forgotten. However, those that had been trained and
forgotten could be retrained in about three minutes (He Liu, 2022).

A new theory from scientists at Trinity College, Dublin, and the
University of Toronto suggests that forgetting is a form of learning.
The rate of forgetting is impacted by environmental conditions and they
suggest forgetting means we can be more flexible and adapt to different
environments, which also enhances decision-making. They propose that the
original memories are still there but circuits are remodelled so the
'activation codes' for memories are switched off (Deane, 2022).

There are other reasons it's useful to know about forgetting too. If
you're about to teach a new procedure, what you may have to do at the
same time is to ask people to forget the previous procedure. A colleague
of mine, []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_153 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 153"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Jonathan Stevens, teaches touch-typing in a very
innovative and successful way. His biggest challenge is to get people to
forget their old habits of horrible typing techniques in order to
touch-type effectively, not only increasing their typing speed but often
correcting years of painful necks and shoulders.

One piece of research from Germany shows it may be possible to help
people forget by telling them to do it (Dreisbach and Bauml, 2014).
Subjects learnt to give specific key presses to specific words chosen at
random until they were 100 per cent accurate. They came back the next
day and one half of the group were then trained on a new 'key press'
task and they found that the key presses they'd learnt the day before
kept interfering in their new learning so they didn't perform as well.
The other half of the group were told that the computer had crashed
overnight and had lost all their sequences so they could forget
everything they'd learnt and just start again. This group performed
significantly better on day two despite actually doing the same tasks as
the first group. Researchers surmised that they chose to forget what
they'd learnt because it wasn't relevant anymore. Clearly, on this task
the learning was still quite new so it may be easier to disrupt it with
a simple order to forget it.

If you put this into a real-world scenario, it may have implications for
what happens when people go back to work after a training course.
Regularly people go on a training course and come back with some nice,
new, fragile information in their memories. Occasionally they are
literally told to forget -- 'well you can forget all that fancy stuff
you learnt on the course and get back to some real work'. Or it may be
more implicit; all the contextual cues around them are for their old
habits, which makes it much easier to remember the old habit and to
forget the new one.

## [How to help your learners remember](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_09_CHAP_C09_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h2_005 .head-a}

It's all very well having all this great information about how memory
works but unless you've got some practical ideas about helping people
remember then it's all just neuroscience! How can you make it easier to
encode, store and retrieve memories, so people use them to improve their
performance?

### Rich embroidery {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_008 .head-b}

One of the big shiny keys to memory is to encode things more richly,
with more gilded decoration and noisy fanfare so that you have many more
[]{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_154 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 154"
role="doc-pagebreak"}access points to pick up that information later.
It's like the difference between trying to pick up an egg with no shell
that slips through your fingers or picking up a knobbly piece of wood
complete with twigs and leaves-- there are lots of easy 'handles' to
pick up the information.

#### 1. Links {.head-c}

When you try to remember something new it's so much easier if you can
link it to something you already know because you're working on stitches
that are already in your tapestry. You're building on the networks of
neurons that already exist rather than having to start building new
wobbly ones:

- Ask people questions about what they already know and then thread the
  new learning onto those current ideas. Asking questions fires up
  neurons in an effort to find the answer. The relevant neurons are then
  active and you can hang new information onto those excited neurons.

- Refer to everyday situations that we can all relate to.

- Ask about work situations that relate to the topic in hand.

- Relate ideas to popular TV, films, books, etc.

- Encourage people to choose their own links.

#### 2. Emotion {.head-c}

Emotion is to memory what Juliet is to Romeo -- without the emotional
content, ideas lack any life. Business can be seen as rational,
measurable and objective, which somehow seems to filter down into
believing that information has to be rational and objective too. But
humans don't work like that; you use emotions to give strength to data
so you can measure it subjectively and intuitively as well as
objectively. You recall information more easily when it's emotional, but
you may not always recall the information you intend to remember and
sometimes your emotional memories may literally lead you down the wrong
roads.

I visit a friend in Luton only occasionally and I almost always take the
wrong turning at a particular T-junction near his house, usually causing
me to get emotional and call myself stupid. So if emotions strengthen
memory, why don't I remember the correct way? It turns out it's partly
because I let my brain tag the incorrect route with a stronger emotion
than the correct route, plus there's a crucial lapse of time. When I
first went the wrong way it made me feel anxious, lost and late -- I had
to turn around and go back once I realized it was the wrong way. But the
emotion of relief that I was []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_155 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 155" role="doc-pagebreak"}going the right way wasn't as
strong as the anxiety/fear in the first place and I was paying less
attention because I then knew which way to go.

It's usually about a year before I revisit Luton and the memory trace
isn't particularly strong because I've done nothing to strengthen it in
all that time. So, as I approach the junction my brain calls up all the
information relating to that junction, including an emotion, and I
remember being there before. But the actual emotional memory has faded
and all it gives me is a slightly stronger link to the incorrect route
which therefore feels more 'familiar' -- so it must be the right way.
And yet again I choose the wrong way and have to turn around again. Of
course I curse myself again for being a fool and so I retag the
incorrect route with a strong emotion, barely paying any attention to
the correct route. Guess what happens about a year later... This feeling
of familiarity can be a challenge for recalling all sorts of information
when there are emotions and longer timescales involved.

How could I change this pattern? To pay much more attention to the
correct road, when I choose it, and to give myself a huge cheer for
getting it right. Negative emotions tend to carry more weight than
positive ones because they are the ones that keep us out of danger, so
I'll have to work doubly hard on praising the correct choice. This could
be relevant for your participants too -- help them pay more attention to
and connect stronger emotions to correct choices to balance up the
emotional memory equation. Most of all, help people feel the emotions
that go with the information they are learning -- dry data doesn't
stick.

#### 3. Anchoring learning {.head-c}

Anchors are a specific way of using the sort of associative learning you
read about in [Chapter 4](#04_CHAP_C04.xhtml), connecting neuronal
networks that are already strong and well used. Effectively you
repeatedly link two specific ideas together so that the presence of one
reminds you of the other; you're actively practising Hebb's Law (cells
that fire together wire together). You'll remember that I have
previously mentioned linking chocolate to the basic structure of the
brain and repeating and repeating this association. Many years later,
people still tell me that they always think of the brain when they see a
bar of chocolate. As long as you link the ideas together sufficiently
you can create anchors to all sorts of things: objects, music, ideas,
smells, phrases. Anchors can also be physical, such as pinching two
fingers together to link to a particular emotional state that you may
want to recreate later, or counting ideas off on your fingers.

#### []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_156 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 156" role="doc-pagebreak"}4. Repetition, repetition, repetition and meaning {.head-c}

You've already read about how repetition is required if you want to keep
a memory accurate. Anyone who, like me, learnt their times tables by
chanting at school knows the power of repetition on memory. Only
yesterday someone asked me what 11 × 12 was and was surprised that I
knew the answer without even having to stop to think -- 132. You may
have your own particular poem or speech you learnt at school that as
soon as you start it you can finish it -- your neurons know which
connections to make without you putting much conscious effort into it.
People can memorize meaningless strings of information, if necessary,
through repetition but meaning makes things even easier to remember.
Hermann Ebbinghaus was one of the fathers of psychology and famously
learnt multiple meaningless strings of information discovering that if
you do nothing active to review your memory you'll forget most of the
information. His famous curve of exponential forgetting from 1885 can be
roughly described by the following formula:

<figure id="_09_CHAP_C09_UFigure_9_1" class="figure">
<p><img src="content/images/M09EQ001.png"
alt="R equals e to-the-power-of minus fraction t over s" /></p>
</figure>

> where *R* is memory retention, *S* is the relative strength of memory,
> *t* is time and *e* is a mathematical constant.

It is Ebbinghaus' often replicated study that is the basis of the idea
that you forget 80 per cent of what you've learnt within 24 hours. When
you learn without meaning and without repeating the memories later you
are very likely to forget most of what you learnt. You'll read more
about the importance of reviewing, repeating and getting neurons to
refire in [Chapter 11](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml) on reviewing.

#### 5. Novelty and meaning {.head-c}

Make information stand out in people's heads against the mass of
everyday information. Novelty works because it raises our attention
levels and causes a momentary frisson of discomfort, even fear, because
you don't necessarily know how to react to the new situation or
information. This lets your amygdala tag the information as important to
remember just in case you come across it again. Novelty for novelty's
sake isn't enough for training and especially for learning at work --
meaningful, valuable information combined with novelty is going to give
you a return on your investment whereas novelty alone is really a
frivolity.

#### []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_157 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 157" role="doc-pagebreak"}6. Stories and meaning {.head-c}

Which is easier for you to remember? This haiku poem from Basho Matsuo,
the first great poet of haiku in the 1600s:

> An old silent pond...
>
> A frog jumps into the pond,
>

Humans have been remembering stories since time began and I expect you
probably tell stories, even if you don't necessarily label them stories.
Sometimes trainers tell me that they don't use stories and then go on to
tell me an anecdote about someone else who tells stories. Anecdotes,
metaphors and analogies are all stories in their own way. Stories are
memorable because they're emotive, use multisensory language, have a
structure that helps to prepare our brains to recognize what's coming
and often they cause heightened attention because of a dilemma or some
novelty factor. They also give meaning to information and we find
meaningful things easier to remember than non-meaningful things. You'll
come across stories again in [Chapter 12](#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml).

#### 7. Organization and chunking {.head-c}

Before you go on to read about some other ideas to help memory
retention, have you noticed anything about the first set of six 'memory
aids' that would help you to remember them? Did you notice the acrostic
(the first letter of each memory aid) spells out LEARNS? **L**inks,
**E**motion, **A**nchors, **R**epetition, **N**ovelty and **S**tories.
You can easily use this LEARNS mnemonic as a checklist to see how sticky
your learning designs are.

Acrostics are a useful way to remember information because they create
links and meaning between information that isn't necessarily obviously
linked. Numbers can also help to organize information and improve recall
because at least you know how many pieces of your puzzle you have to
fill.

Anything that helps us to organize information into meaningful 'chunks'
can help with learning and recall, but chunking is most powerful when
learners choose their own categories to put information into. So giving
[]{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_158 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 158"
role="doc-pagebreak"}people opportunities to organize and sort
information will make it more meaningful and easier to recall as well as
delivering the information in chunks in the first place. Sometimes, as
trainers you may end up sorting and categorizing information in an
effort to reduce cognitive overload, but in fact it might be better for
learners' memories if you let them do the work for themselves. Sometimes
the process of learning can be contradictory.

#### 8. Smell {.head-c}

Smell is often underestimated as a tool of learning, particularly in
organizational environments, where people aren't inclined to think about
smell as something that belongs at work, unless you work in a perfumery
of course. Smell is particularly powerful for memory when there's an
emotional context to the memory or it's an autobiographical, episodic
memory that's being recalled. Smell is less successful for retrieving
facts, i.e. semantic memories. Receptors in our nose are stimulated by
the arrival of a chemical, i.e. a smell, and they start to fire
excitedly and communicate with the neurons in your olfactory bulb, which
sits nearer to the hypothalamus than your other sensory processing
areas. Unlike your other sensory receptors your olfactory receptors are
exposed directly to the outside world; visual receptors and auditory
receptors are buffered by your cornea and your ear drums so there's
already a slight barrier to communication. On top of that, all the other
sensory messages have to pass through the thalamus before they connect
to relevant cortical areas, but the messages to your olfactory cortex
don't have to take this indirect route -- they just go straight there to
be processed. A key destination for information about odours is your
amygdala, so smells directly stimulate emotions, which as you know
already, strengthen memories. Information about smells also goes to
higher cortical areas like the orbitofrontal cortex which is relevant in
decision-making. Does this mean you'll make your decisions based on
smell alone? It's unlikely, but smell might add weight to your decision
and is definitely going to strengthen your memory.

If smell is such a strong evoker of memories then it could pay to use it
more at work. Studies regularly show that students who link particular
smells to particular topics are more easily able to recall that
information in exams if they use the smell as a stimulus to the memory.
However, research by Luisa Bogenschütz from the University of Hildesheim
showed that there is a difference between memories elicited by smells
which can bring back strong feelings and memories associated with smells
that seem to be stored differently and don't always bring back strong
feelings (Reynolds, 2022)

[]{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_159 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 159"
role="doc-pagebreak"}But remember, smell is most effective when linked
to episodic and emotional material so creating smelly, emotional and
story-like links to dry, dusty information is going to optimize your
chances of remembering it.

### Context {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_009 .head-b}

As well as remembering richly embroidered information, another key to
stronger memories is context. We've all done it -- you had to go back
downstairs to remember why you came upstairs in the first place. Is it
the physical activity that stimulates the brain with a better flow of
oxygen? Or, more likely, it's going back to the same physical
environment that reminds you of what you were about to do. This is
similar to context-dependent learning. The classic experiment for this
was when Godden and Baddeley (the same Baddeley who defined encoding,
storage and retrieval) studied the effect in 1975 with divers who were
asked to remember 36 unrelated, two- and three-syllable words (Godden
and Baddeley, 1975). When tested later, their recall was better on land
if they'd learnt on land and better underwater if they learnt
underwater.

The effect also seems to extend to our mental states, our mood and even
our level of intoxication. While alcohol will usually make learning
worse, students who learnt five-word sentences while 'under the
influence' were able to recall it better when 'drunk' than 'sober'
(Goodwin et al, 1969; Weingartner et al, 1976). Learning was superior
though when students were sober rather than drunk; so you only need to
have a drink to find your keys if you were drunk when you put them down.

What does this mean for training? Would we be better running training
courses at work rather than in hotels or special training rooms? Quite
possibly. Try to create similar conditions for learning as will exist
back at work when the person needs to recall what they learnt and apply
it. While you might not have access to flight simulators or virtual
reality, you can perhaps use actors/colleagues to recreate realistic
situations and use real case studies from your business rather than
invented ones. Take a leaf out of sports trainers' books and ask people
to visualize taking their new learning into the workplace --
visualization causes us to activate similar pathways in your brain as
those used in actual performance. Rather than teaching abstract
theoretical constructs, make discussions, conversations and exercises
concrete and relate to the real world that people experience at work.
Remember you can create context through the physical, environmental,
psychological and emotional environment.

### []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_160 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 160" role="doc-pagebreak"}When to sleep on it {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h3_010 .head-b}

When is a good time to learn something, and should you sleep on it to
enhance your learning? You've already read that sleep is vital for
memory but what you learn and when you sleep might be important.
Procedural learning (the skills you do rather than talk about) seems to
be most effective just before sleep. It's thought we may dream about the
skills and effectively practise them in our sleep. On the other hand,
learning facts or information, which is dependent on 'declarative
memory', seems to be more effective if the learning starts in the
afternoon, about seven and a half hours before sleep, though the
evidence from this research is slightly less robust.

One thing I've found particularly helpful for learners is to explain to
them that receiving information is only the start of the learning
process and that if they feel 'full' of information at the end of a day
they will feel more comfortable the next day after they've slept on it.
The first thing this does is to reduce their anxiety levels and my
experience is that the next day they say the information now seems to
have settled into their brains. Sleep has become a huge area of research
with regular new discoveries so you can find out more in [Chapter
13](#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml) which is devoted entirely to sleep and learning.

## [Summary](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_09_CHAP_C09_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml__09_CHAP_C09_h2_006 .head-a}

Here's a partial summary and your opportunity to put your memory to the
test and see what you can remember from this chapter. The answers are at
the end of the book on [page 299](#18_CHAP_C18.xhtml_page_299), but
before you peek remember how much better you will remember it if you
recall or even guess first:

1.  Memory is incredibly complex and is not entirely understood.

2.  What part of your brain is vital for memory and exchanges
    information backwards and forwards between your cortex, limbic
    system, cerebellum, and multiple other brain structures?

3.  You have different types of memory: declarative and \_\_.

4.  Name the main two types of declarative memory.

5.  You also have emotional memories and \_\_ memories, which are
    non-declarative.

6.  What are the three stages of memory described by Alan Baddeley?

7.  Use rich encoding to help information stick in long-term memory.

8.  []{#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml_page_161 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 161"
    role="doc-pagebreak"}When are your memories mainly consolidated?

9.  When you recall information, you pull information from many sources
    and effectively rebuild it afresh each time.

10. Forgetting new information is easier than forgetting old
    information.

11. What's the mnemonic you can use to design 'sticky' learning?

12. Organization, smell, context and sleep also enhance memory.

Most of us who work in a learning and development environment would like
to think of ourselves as helpful people who want to inspire others to
learn successfully and effectively. We spend time, energy and resources
on creating pleasant and stimulating learning environments and we
believe people should, and can, enjoy learning. You may believe it's
appropriate to reward people for getting the correct answer; we give out
degrees because people get the questions right in the exams; at school
we give ticks and gold stars when work is correct. Even at work, we
reward people with smiles, 'good answer', or gaming points when they get
an answer right.

However, a study from 2006 shows that perhaps what you ought to be doing
is punishing correct answers (Finn and Roediger, 2011). Yes, you read
that correctly, and it is seemingly in contradiction to the advice in
the last chapter on providing positive memories. You should perhaps
punish correct answers because it seems to improve people's memories for
what they learnt -- at the testing stage. In this particular experiment
people were asked to learn some Swahili/English word pairs and were then
tested on their recall. When they got an answer right they were shown
either a neutral picture or an unpleasant one. When they were retested
later the group who'd seen the unpleasant pictures had better recall of
the word pairs than both people who'd seen neutral pictures and those
who'd merely reviewed the word pairs passively.

Now, as with many psychology experiments, this was an artificial
situation and it doesn't necessarily mean that we should all start
punishing our learners for getting things right. But it does yet again
show how important []{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_164 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 164" role="doc-pagebreak"}emotional links are for
learning, even negative ones. Performance was improved because the
increased arousal felt by the people who saw the unpleasant images
attached itself to the learnt topic and was more effective than having
no emotions attached. The other important lesson from this study was the
importance of recalling information as part of the learning process
rather than just passively reviewing the information again, i.e. testing
improves your learning. The researchers didn't test the effect with
positive images, which again demonstrates the narrowness of scientific
studies and why you really have to look at a range of different results
and studies -- meta-analysis.

## [Why it's important to test, experiment and practise while learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_10_CHAP_C10_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h2_002 .head-a}

In [Chapter 9](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml) on memory you came across the process
of consolidation where neuronal connections are strengthened when they
have recently been used which helps us learn new skills, knowledge or
even attitudes. The opportunity for active recall makes learning stick
for the long term. Just exposing people to information is insufficient
for learning to be really effective. One of the key messages from
psychology is the benefit of testing for recall rather than merely
refamiliarizing yourself with the material, which seems to create
overconfidence. If you remember back to the story of me feeling
confident about which direction to take in Luton it's a similar sort of
problem. When you see the material you've seen before your brain
registers it as something familiar and that familiarity tells you that
you're confident you've seen it before -- which you are but you're not
going to necessarily be competent at recalling it.

In this chapter (described in [Figure
10.1](#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_Figure_10_1)) you'll explore why
to test learning and how, where and when to do it.

### For designers and trainers {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_001 .head-b}

As a designer or trainer there is value in testing your learners because
it means you can check whether they've got hold of the right end of the
stick and whether you've done your job effectively. For some training
this may be crucial because knowing exactly how to defuse a bomb in a
real-life situation may make a significant difference compared to having
read about it in []{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_165 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 165" role="doc-pagebreak"}a book. For other areas of
learning there may be less at stake but it's still useful to be
confident that learners have gone away with the right skills,
information or knowledge and that they can use it in relevant
situations.

### To improve performance {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_002 .head-b}

Testing has been known to be an effective tool as part of learning since
the first documented empirical study in 1917 by A.I. Gates where they
showed learning was enhanced by recitation. Another study in 1992 by
Carrier and Pashler showed that testing wasn't just another chance to
practise but that it produced better results. Learners who actively
tested their knowledge during practice could remember more information
than learners who spent the same amount of time just studying the
information. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that retrieving
information is more effective than merely being re-exposed to it. This
all makes sense because learners have to make the effort to recall that
information from wherever it's stored, which reconsolidates the memory
rather than just checking whether it's familiar. You'll remember from
[Chapter 9](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml) on memory that something that's familiar
may be a false friend.

At work, significant amounts of time and energy are spent with senior
managers presenting their vision of the future, or the company structure
or the systems architecture over and over again, when they would
probably find if they merely kept quiet and asked the audience to tell
them about it people would remember the information better. Learning is
improved by active testing but, as you'll read later, testing may not
always be as effective as it could be.

### []{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_166 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 166" role="doc-pagebreak"}To increase confidence and motivation {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_003 .head-b}

What other reasons are there for learners to test their learning apart
from it improving their performance? One key factor is the confidence it
can give them to see their progress and the added benefit of showing
them that learning is a slow, effortful process and not a magic wand
that trainers and educators can wave. Have you ever felt frustrated when
you're learning something new and not making progress? My squash game
was like that as I took those coaching sessions and I wasn't the only
one losing games as I struggled with a new serve. While I was in a game
my serve went wrong but when I was back in the safety of a coaching
session I could carefully test my lob serve and get it right, and that
progress motivated me to continue practising. I needed to practise
sufficiently to use the lob serve effectively in a game; but the testing
showed me I'd not become entirely incompetent.

### To make adjustments {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_004 .head-b}

Testing lets you make adjustments to your new skills or new knowledge,
hopefully in safe situations where you can make mistakes without serious
consequences. When you learn something new those new neural connections
aren't as strong as you need them to be, so they are prone to
interference from old habits and you also need to make fine adjustments.
This is true about learning a new motor skill like a sport or learning
to be a neurosurgeon but is also the case for other more cognitive
activities. Have you ever watched a colleague come back from a training
course and practise their new-found behavioural skills? I remember
someone who had recently been on a communication skills programme and it
was positively painful watching her test her skills because they weren't
yet natural to her. It was almost comical watching her consciously
rehearse her 'build rapport' routine: shake hands with required firmness
-- check; make eye contact -- check; mirror body language -- check. When
I met her again later these skills had become automatic and she greeted
people without having consciously to go through her checklist.

I'm sure you already suggest to your learners that they practise on safe
ground first; activities such as negotiating with your toddler before
going in to talk to your boss about a raise in salary. Practise in an
environment where you can check, adjust, replay and check again until
the learning becomes automatic.

### []{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_167 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 167" role="doc-pagebreak"}To change habits {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_005 .head-b}

Think about your brain and compare the differences between a
well-established neuronal network with cells that have been firing
together for years and the wobbly neuronal network that is tentatively
being created thanks to the really useful training programme you
attended yesterday. When you're back at work and you're thrown into a
situation where you want to use your new learning, imagine what's going
on.

For a start, you normally spend a lot of time operating on autopilot; a
situation occurs and you just respond automatically; a stimulus appears
and your habitual response kicks in. Robert Cialdini (2001) describes
this very effectively in his book, *Influence: Science and Practice*, as
the 'click-whirr' mechanism that you can see in baby birds when they see
a parent with food. They're wired to respond that way; and we have
similar strongly wired behaviour too. Our habituated responses are
strong; they've served us relatively well until now and to break those
habits takes effort, energy and resources.

First of all you must recognize it is a situation where the new learning
could be effective, then you have to suppress all that activity that
your well-wired pathways have started and go looking for the new,
wobblier pathways. The new task is likely to activate far more of the
prefrontal cortex so you can pay attention to what's going on and the
prefrontal cortex is energy hungry. Recognizing that you've got a new
skill to implement will increase your attention and arousal levels so
suddenly you've got more stress hormones moving around your brain and
body and stress hormones are known to reduce performance on cognitive
tasks. So even if your new skill is physical you've just made it more
cognitive by being so painfully aware of what you're doing.

As you learn a new skill it's not going to be as perfect or as
well-honed as done by someone who's an expert. When you're learning
you're going to have to make lots of adjustments and correct errors. The
prediction of error seems to happen in your right prefrontal cortex but
the detection of errors may be done by the anterior cingulate gyrus,
which is connected both to your cortex and your amygdala thereby
responding to emotional and cognitive components of learning.

### []{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_168 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 168" role="doc-pagebreak"}Neuroscience of habits {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_006 .head-b}

Making and breaking habits has gained a lot more attention in recent
years and many new discoveries are shedding more light on the process
inside our brains. Charles Duhigg in his book, *The Power of Habit*
(Duhigg, 2013), suggests that habits can't be broken and can always lurk
ready to pop up again, sometimes when you least want them. Conversely,
it's also hard to learn new habits whether you're trying to replace an
old one or just starting something entirely new.

There is a strong dopaminergic pathway between the frontal cortex and
the striatum (one of the basal ganglia) and this is heavily implicated
in the making and breaking of habits. As you consciously learn and
practise something your goal-directed behaviour is mainly controlled by
the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC -- an area of the prefrontal cortex mainly
responsible for decision-making). Because of the strong connections
between the OFC as you achieve your goal, the striatum releases dopamine
so you feel rewarded and want to repeat the behaviour. But as your
behaviour becomes habitual, the levels of dopamine, at a cellular level,
drop so you don't get the same reward any more. So, after a time
management course you get back to work and practise your new routine of
only checking your e-mails at lunchtime and get the reward of feeling
virtuous and making those phone calls instead. But after a little while
that reward is less 'rewarding' and if the habit hasn't become fully
engrained then it's really easy to slip back into the old routine
because that in itself has some reward associated with it; perhaps the
sense of 'being busy' that checking your e-mails gives you.

Another study (Gremel et al, 2016) suggests that less well-known
neurotransmitters called endocannabinoids may be the ones that
effectively change a conscious cortical activity into a habitual
unconscious activity. Endocannabinoids are linked to physical activity
and are one of the factors responsible for a 'runner's high'. It seems
they begin to reduce activity in the OFC so that your actions become
more unconscious and less goal-directed and harder therefore to change.
These researchers predict that this discovery will make endocannabinoids
as famous as dopamine and endorphins.

Along with that discovery is another (Martiros et al, 2018) showing how
a habitual pattern of behaviour is marked in the striatum as a specific
sequence and is one reason why it's hard to break persistent habits. If
you think for instance of a habit like brushing your teeth there is a
relatively complicated sequence of behaviours that lets you pick up the
brush, spread on the toothpaste, brush in multiple directions, etc. When
the habit is new []{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_169 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 169" role="doc-pagebreak"}the striatum fires
consistently throughout the pattern of connected behaviours but as the
sequence is repeated day-in and day-out the firing becomes clustered at
the beginning and end of the task and this pattern becomes much harder
to break.

Habits usually have a trigger or cue, a routine and a reward and you can
break a habit by changing any one of them. Sometimes the trick is to
identify which part you have the most influence or control over.

### Changing habits and CARS {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_007 .head-b}

Evidence-based research indicates it takes anything between 16 days to
eight months to break a habit but the average is about two months -- not
21 days as sometimes reported. If you fail occasionally it won't ruin
the effort -- carry on with the chosen behaviour and you'll get there.
But be aware the old habit is probably still lurking so here is a
framework to help change habits:

- **Cues** -- the things you encounter regularly that you have linked to
  particular behaviours -- you need to identify your cues to certain
  behaviour patterns.

- **Actions** -- the things you do in response to the Cues -- you want
  to change these actions into new habits.

- **Rewards** -- what you get as a result of the Actions -- you may find
  the reward remains the same or you may require a new reward.

- **SIMPLE** ideas -- to improve your success at building new habits:

  - **S** -- Small steps -- don't try to change everything at once but
    start with small, easy-to-implement changes (Clear, 2019).

  - **I** -- Increase your efforts as you find the changes are working;
    you may want to try new connected habits or extend the current one.

  - **M** -- Miss an action; if you miss an action occasionally it won't
    affect your habit formation. You don't want to get emotional about
    having missed it because that may well reinforce the old habit; you
    simply return to the required action and reward yourself again.
    Often, it's sufficient simply to be pleased you've returned to your
    new habit. It's not hard to provoke your brain into a dopamine
    release.

  - **P** -- Practise regularly -- all habits need repetition to
    diminish the previous habit and build new strong pathways (remember
    neuroplasticity).

  - []{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_170 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 170"
    role="doc-pagebreak"}**L** -- Link to similar habits to improve your
    chances of being successful. Imagine for instance you want to learn
    a new language and already have the habit of checking your phone in
    the morning so you simply add a language app to your morning
    routine.

  - **E** -- Environment -- change your environment so you don't
    experience cues for previous habits that undermine the new one.
    Imagine you want to spend more time at work moving rather than
    sitting. Change your desk to an adjustable standing desk and as you
    leave at night make sure it's in the standing position so when you
    arrive in the morning it's just as easy to stand as sit.

## [How to test](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_10_CHAP_C10_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h2_003 .head-a}

Testing is a key part of learning because it lets us see where we're
going wrong, what we're doing well, and to make adjustments, but it's
not the end of the learning journey -- it's just a part of it and it can
upset things when it's not done well.

I was lucky enough to go to a wine tasting course with one of my
daughters. It was an excellent day out and we learnt a lot about wine;
where it came from, what wine went with what food, how to tell a
Sauvignon Blanc from a Chardonnay, and other useful and delicious
things. The bonus was we got an official certificate at the end to prove
we had learnt something. Now, I don't know about you, but surely the
most important part of wine tasting is the skill of being able to tell
your Shiraz from your Merlot rather than the semantic memory that Shiraz
is the same as Syrah and comes from the Rhône area of France. Having
spent the day pouring, peering at, smelling and tasting wine we had to
do a multiple-choice test that merely tested our familiarity with the
facts. The things that were new to me and I really was learning weren't
included in the test. Eighteen months on I had to Google that
information about the Shiraz grape being the same as Syrah even though I
have a certificate to prove I passed the test.

We have a tendency to test people's semantic memory or their knowledge
of facts because it's quite easy. We most commonly still do this in
written tests but a lot of what we need to learn isn't semantic
knowledge but practical skills. Thinking back to Howard Gardner's
Multiple Intelligences you'll begin to see why this is not necessarily
helpful to all learners or for all types of learning. Being able to
describe a skill (declarative memory) is not the same as being able to
do it (non-declarative memory) Gardner believes it's
[]{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_171 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 171"
role="doc-pagebreak"}better to measure intelligence by observation of
action in the real world. Real-world work based activities and tests are
better for your learners too (remember the A and R from the GEAR model).

If you are able to influence learning techniques in your environment
then please think about how you test learning and what you're testing.
Someone may be able to write a superb essay for their MBA on running a
business, but would you put them in charge of your most important
business unit without some further real-world experience and testing?

Testing is a vital part of the learning process so let's see what else
you can do to test.

Programmatic assessment

Programmatic assessment focuses on optimizing learning by making regular
assessments as people learn, rather than summative assessments where all
the testing is done at the end of a piece of learning like in old-school
exams.

In a joint research project in 2020 with the University of Antwerp and
Stellar Labs we looked at various programmatic assessment measures
gathered during a Train the Trainer programme. The programme had six
modules of asynchronous and synchronous learning plus follow up
'mastery' elements to improve transfer of learning into the workplace.
Our hypothesis was that the learning wasn't finished until they could
confidently demonstrate their knowledge and skills back at work over a
three-month period and that programmatic assessment would support
transfer.

What we measured:

Learning and performance

- Did people know the content? -- spaced repetition questions after each
  module for up to three months

- Were they able to perform skills (i.e. deliver training) in a
  simulated context? -- feedback from facilitators and peers of short
  training sessions

- Were they are able to use the content reflectively on their own
  projects back at work? -- feedback from colleagues and peers at work.

Self-efficacy and transfer intention

- Did they feel confident to use the content in their job? -- before and
  after training survey and regular monitoring after the training event

- Did they intend to use the content/skills in their job? -- survey
  before and after training

[]{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_172 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 172"
role="doc-pagebreak"}We discovered that people found it unusual to be
assessed so regularly but overall they found it beneficial to be able to
see their progress and they felt it contributed to their ability to
apply the learning to their work context.

### Teach someone else {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_008 .head-b}

Summarizing and integrating information creates lasting memories because
you have to recall the information. And a really good way to do this is
to teach the information to someone else. You may remember the study
from [Chapter 5](#05_CHAP_C05.xhtml) on motivation where the researchers
found that just expecting to teach something later improved learning.
Two groups were asked to study a passage of text for a later test. One
group were told they would have to teach the text to another group who
would then be tested. This group were able to recall more of the
passage, their recall was better organized and they could correctly
answer more questions. Neither group actually did any teaching but both
were tested so the difference in performance was down to their
expectation they were going to have to teach. That's definitely an
example of a science experiment proving what good trainers already know
-- the best way to learn something is to teach it or at least expect to
have to teach it.

### Drawing as a test {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_009 .head-b}

Testing by drawing is another way to make learning more effective and
you may remember some of those experiments you read about in [Chapter
6](#06_CHAP_C06.xhtml) that suggested drawing could improve learning;
though those experiments were done with children so it's possible the
evidence could be different if adult learners were tested.

Looking back at the research about recall versus recognition, there
seems to be further evidence that having to get the information out of
your head and manipulate or use it in some way is superior to merely
looking at it again. I think this has significant implications for
information delivery at work because often people are given information
at a meeting and then somehow it's expected that they will know that
information forever. How often have you heard someone say 'I've told
them again and again but they just don't do it'? After the 'instruction'
it's worth asking someone to map out the process or draw the
organizational chart for themselves.

One of the added benefits of drawing was that students reported enjoying
learning more when they could draw. This was dismissed in the original
[]{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_173 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 173"
role="doc-pagebreak"}journal article as almost irrelevant to their
research but, of course, if people enjoy learning something they are
more likely to come back for more. Very few people ever say, 'That was a
really miserable experience and I'm just itching to go back and repeat
it'.

### Can neurofeedback improve practice and testing? {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_010 .head-b}

The type of practice you do has an effect on how well you master a
skill, and some interesting research about neurofeedback shows that you
may be able to master a skill much faster if you closely copy what
experts do and get feedback about what's actually happening in your
brain. Neurofeedback is a technique whereby you can measure electrical
brain activity and see or hear feedback to reduce or increase particular
responses in your brain. It seems to be useful for learning some motor
skills, such as target practice for archers, and has been tested on
musical performances, dancing and acting; for instance, actors perform
better by seeing how to get into a more productive 'flow' state.
However, it's not yet been shown to be particularly helpful in
attention-related or cognitive tasks and even the manufacturers of the
neurofeedback equipment recognize that far more serious scientific
research needs to be done to meet some of their claims for performance
enhancement.

### Practice -- the 10,000 hours myth {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_011 .head-b}

You will know that to be good at something you need to practise,
practise, practise -- possibly you were told while you were learning an
instrument or sport at school. Malcolm Gladwell in his book *Outliers*
(2009) suggested that to become an expert you need to practise for
10,000 hours. This idea became popular and is either hugely inspiring or
hugely depressing, depending on the time you have available. If you've
got a handy 10,000 hours then you could become a virtuoso violinist,
perhaps even without much real talent, but if you're short of time then
you're never going to become good at anything, however much talent you
have.

Fortunately, the 10,000 hours has been debunked. Even the original
researcher Anders Ericsson, a Florida State University psychologist,
said that it's not just simple repetition that creates expertise because
you also need feedback in order to adjust your execution to get it
right. It seems the quality of the time you invest in the practice, the
more deliberate you are about it, and the feedback you receive are
equally as important as the amount of time.

[]{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_174 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 174"
role="doc-pagebreak"}You can't cram all your practice into the shortest
time possible because as you already know your brain needs downtime --
time to recover and consolidate what you've learnt. It seems world-class
experts limit themselves to no more than four hours of *focused*
practice per day.

### Creating real-life or virtual environments {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_012 .head-b}

In April 2015 a BBC report mentioned an initiative by an educational
consultant to let children use Google while they were in exams because
this was how they would genuinely revise at home and how they would
access information in the workplace. I can imagine some people were
choking on their cornflakes that morning but it's worth considering the
merit of the suggestion. Context-dependent learning has been shown
repeatedly to work -- remember the 'drunk students' in [Chapter
9](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml) on memory? If people learn by using Google or, of
course, another search engine, and have to use that learning later in a
similar environment then it makes sense to test them under the same
conditions. In a research laboratory if the testing was done under
hugely different conditions to the original learning you'd have peer
reviewers shouting about the lack of consistency in the experiment.

The same thing could be said of learning and testing at work. If the
topic of the training is 'customer support' then the best place to do
the training and for people to test their skills is with customers. One
way to replicate this, or get as near as possible, is to create
realistic scenarios with actors rather than have the forced role play
that many people seem to find embarrassing. When faced with a seemingly
realistic customer, people are better tested and less embarrassed.

Pilots are trained on realistic events using virtual simulators, UK
lifeboat volunteers are tested in huge training tanks where artificial
storms seem awfully real and doctors are trained on neurosurgery using
virtual simulations. Personally, I'm pleased to hear all these people
are tested out on simulations before they get to fly me on holiday or
remove a vital organ. I'd be far less happy if they'd just sat a written
exam. In the years between the first and third edition of this book,
virtual reality has already become much cheaper to design and implement
and a more familiar tool in organizational settings.

## []{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_175 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 175" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Why sometimes testing gets in the way of learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_10_CHAP_C10_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h2_004 .head-a}

### Reducing intrinsic motivation {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_013 .head-b}

One of the joys of learning when you choose to is that lovely feeling of
learning for learning's sake -- your motivation for learning is
intrinsic. Interestingly, when people are rewarded for their learning
they can perform worse. Once tests become something to strive towards as
a reward for learning they become an extrinsic motivator rather than an
intrinsic one. Other rewards for learning that you may be familiar with
are bribing someone to do well in an exam. I'm not talking about the
sort of bribery that gets you sent to prison, but the sort when you tell
your 17-year-old that you'll buy them a car if they pass their driving
test first time or your 18-year-old that you'll pay for their holiday if
they do well in their A-levels.

People who learn for tests tend to have a medium-term memory for the
test but don't retain that knowledge or skill much beyond the test.

### Increasing stress during recall {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h3_014 .head-b}

For most people their most significant experience of testing is at
school, university or a formal qualification later in life. How do you
feel about exams -- those significant tests of your learning? And what
do you now remember about what you learnt for those exams?

Possibly not very much, partially perhaps because it was a long time ago
and you've learnt a lot since, but perhaps because you were at least
marginally stressed when you took those exams? Even the coolest of
cucumbers (note that phrasing for later when we talk about language and
senses) and the most prepared exam sitter usually feels a certain
tension as exam time approaches; the waiting in the corridor with a
bunch of other nervous people, the unnatural quiet of the exam room, the
strict faces of the invigilators and all those rules about what you can
and can't take in. The chances are your adrenaline levels were high and
so were your cortisol levels. Both adrenaline and cortisol are needed to
help you handle stress appropriately but a) both hormones evolved at a
time when being under stress usually meant you had to fight or run away,
and b) they help under short-term conditions of stress but they are not
particularly good for you over the longer term. In a study in the
*Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience* in 2013 (Ackermann et al, 2013)
scientists found higher cortisol levels didn't have a particularly
detrimental effect as people were learning or encoding information
[]{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_176 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 176"
role="doc-pagebreak"}but it did seem to decrease their recall,
particularly if they were more inclined to be stressed anyway. Their
results suggested it was the change in cortisol levels that had a
particular impact on retrieval; people who already had strong baseline
responses to stress, i.e. they were stressed more easily, found it more
difficult than less stressed people to recall memories in stressful
situations like exams.

If this is the case, why do we persist in putting people through
stressful exams that are not particularly like the situations in which
they will have to apply their learning?

Even my wine exam felt stressful despite the fact I really didn't care
whether I got a certificate or not. Still, while I can't quite remember
where the Shiraz grape grows most readily, I can still tell a Shiraz
from a Merlot when I taste them so I did learn what was important.

## [Tests of learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_10_CHAP_C10_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h2_005 .head-a}

In our 'Train the Trainer' programmes we want people to go away with as
many new and stimulating ideas as they can. We encourage them to steal
our ideas but we also believe that generating their own ideas and
testing their own creative skills is a valuable part of the programme.
It gives them greater flexibility and far more options than they've used
before.

Here are some ideas about testing culled from these brain-friendly
'Train the Trainer' programmes where we ask them to devise 52 ways to
test learning -- a different test for every week of the year:

> Quizzes, crosswords, anagrams, puzzles, variations on TV game shows,
> jigsaws, create or build models, write essays, produce a video, radio
> programmes, podcasts, written exams, spoken exams, draw ideas,
> practise on dummies, case studies, real-life scenarios, write a song,
> poem or rap, devise questions to ask another team, build a replica,
> body sculpture, write a log, write a diary entry, draw a cartoon
> strip, teach someone else, sort and categorize information, fill in
> the blanks, tweet, devise a metaphor, create a game, make a flowchart,
> work with actors, do an experiment, recitation, brain storm, do a
> presentation, operate the machinery under safe conditions, virtual
> environments, explain to a colleague, mindmap, blog, teach on a
> webinar, make a set of postcards, discussion, interview each other,
> analyse a situation, work with a customer, action learning sets,
> contribute to forums, fill fortune cookies, make buttons, choreograph
> a dance, bandage a volunteer...

[]{#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml_page_177 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 177"
role="doc-pagebreak"}I'm sure you can easily devise more tests based on
what you train. Use the multiple intelligences as a starting point for
ideas and don't be limited by what you've seen or heard before.

## [Summary](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_10_CHAP_C10_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml__10_CHAP_C10_h2_006 .head-a}

You could choose to test your learning from this chapter by writing or
drawing your own summary.

But if you feel you want some support here are the highlights:

- Testing is a key point of the learning process and active recall beats
  passive recognition every time.

- It helps you as a trainer to check that the learning is going in the
  right direction and to make adjustments if necessary.

- Learners get the benefits of improved performance, higher confidence
  and motivation, time to make adjustments and change their habits.

- You can test learning by many means apart from exams including
  drawing, teaching someone else, neurofeedback, making it as realistic
  as possible.

- Testing can get in the way of learning if it reduces motivation or
  increases stress.

- Add your own ideas to the list of 52 Ways to Test Learning.

Occasionally, for a bit of creative fun, my colleagues and I have
thought about designing a 'Truly Terrible Training Course'. I will
confess that the idea started in response to a particularly difficult
couple of days in a training room but more often we do it as a reverse
psychology style exercise where we get people to turn everything they've
learnt about designing fabulous learning on its head. It gets people
laughing (releases endorphins and reduces stress levels), challenges
assumptions and encourages people to see learning from multiple
viewpoints, activating their frontal cortex.

We ask people to design a Truly Terrible Training Course from the points
of view of the learners, the trainers and the organization. A regular
suggestion is not to review any learning once the information has been
shot at people through 1,000 PowerPoint Bullets. I did say it was a
Truly Terrible Training Course. Not reviewing means the truly terrible
trainers can finish and go home early so they're happy, at least in the
short term. But the learners who aren't asked to review can't see the
point of what they've learnt and forget it almost immediately and the
organization is furious because they've wasted all that money and nobody
remembers anything so they can't do their jobs properly. The
organization calls in the trainers and fires them because they're so
inept, so now the trainers aren't happy either.

This chapter is about reflecting on and reviewing learning so that it
sticks and transfers to the workplace. This is one of the most valuable,
but often neglected, areas of learning design and delivery, and may be
one that requires a culture change in your organization.

## []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_180 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 180" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Why you need to review and take action -- what it feels like when you don't](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_11_CHAP_C11_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h2_002 .head-a}

You've probably experienced learning a new skill or information, and
initially found it interesting or useful but then a day or so later you
come to think about it or do it again and somehow it seems ephemeral;
you can't quite remember the details though you've got a general feel
for them. You are certain there are six parts to the really useful
learning process that you've just read about but you just can't bring
back to mind the middle two elements. Or you can't quite remember how to
actually use the new project planning tool.

Perhaps the training was well designed, the information was stimulating
for you, strongly multisensory and relevant. You probably spent time
experimenting with new skills and told your family about them when you
got home. You definitely encoded it in your memory and you could recall
the information initially, so what's gone wrong now? Why are the details
you need so faint? The evidence shows that you need to review and
practise repeatedly over a longer period to master your skills and
transfer them into the workplace.

In this chapter you'll read about what happens in your brain when you
review learning, how to practise effectively, and you'll think about
some of the challenges that prevent effective retention and transfer
into the busy world of work and what to do about it. You'll uncover some
crucial timings that improve retention and find out who else needs to be
involved. [Figure 11.1](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_Figure_11_1)

How long do you need to remember new information for? There is some
information you want to remember for a significant length of time, and
other information you need to know for now, but you know you'll need to
[]{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_181 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 181"
role="doc-pagebreak"}replace it with something else later. Imagine how
actors learn their lines. While the play is running they need to be word
perfect but once it's finished they want to replace that knowledge with
a whole new set of lines and don't want interference from the first set
of lines (see back to [Chapter 9](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml) on memory to
remember how important 'forgetting' is to your continued learning and
healthy cognitive function). If it's a new process at work that's taken
a long time to implement and is a fundamental shift in your way of
working, then you may need to remember the new behaviour for years or
more. Other skills like negotiating, coding or driving a forklift truck,
are skills you may want to hang on to for the rest of your life.

Reviewing and practice are a vital part of memory consolidation --
revisiting and repeating the learning over time helps to strengthen the
neuronal pathways and the opportunity to break old habits and create new
ones.

As a committed professional you want to pack maximum value and learning
into any learning event but you're regularly under pressure to cram a
lot of information into a short time, particularly if it's a programme
that people have invested a lot of time and money into. Sometimes you
get to the end of your sessions with very little time left. It's
tempting to leave out the review and just hope that the learning
happened but the end-of-session review is just the start of a vital part
of the learning process that leads to long term transfer into work.

## [Reviewing -- the story of a beautiful relationship](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_11_CHAP_C11_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h2_003 .head-a}

One way to think about the power of reviewing is to consider learning to
be like relationships between people; the forging of new neuronal
networks starts like any new relationship when two neurons who haven't
met before are introduced to each other. When you're learning, the
desired end result is to create patterns of strongly connected neurons;
because they fire together they eventually wire together (remember
Hebb's Law) and become stable partners.

On the first introduction your neurons are a bit hesitant -- timid, but
they don't want to commit to anything at this stage. They'll want to
meet a few more times until they feel more sure of each other. When they
meet again they are more comfortable, conversation flows more easily and
they begin to think this new friendship may be going somewhere and it
could be worth making a small commitment to keep in touch. So, they
exchange mobile phone numbers; they can contact each other again if they
need to. After []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_182 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 182" role="doc-pagebreak"}a few more meetings they're
feeling really comfortable together. Communication is easy, rapid and
smooth and they decide to start being seen together regularly. They talk
all the time on the phone and they're texting each other but they could
still see other neurons if they wanted. Eventually they are seeing so
much of each other they decide to move in together and start buying pots
and pans. Time passes and as long as they keep talking and resist the
temptation of more alluring connections they find they are celebrating
their golden wedding anniversary.

Now this is the story of a beautiful long-lasting relationship, but
imagine all the other scenarios that could have happened along the way
if they hadn't kept meeting, if they'd failed to swap mobile numbers, if
some other neuron had come along and offered them something more
exciting and recruited them into another network, or if they'd just
drifted apart because they just weren't seeing enough of one another.

### Reviewing -- the neuroscience of the beautiful relationship {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h3_001 .head-b}

What actually happens isn't the same but I hope the analogy sticks. The
neurons connect across the gap between them (synapses) and exchange
neurotransmitters to stimulate (or sometimes suppress) electrical
signals along their long axons, but initially the signals between them
are relatively weak and not very fast (see [Figure
11.2](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_Figure_11_2)). As neurons fire
repeatedly, the connections strengthen and they fire together more
easily. This is because as the neurons connect, the fatty cover around
the long axons, called a myelin sheath, changes enabling signals to be
transmitted more quickly and efficiently. As networks strengthen, those
myelin sheaths become thicker and act as insulation so that the messages
can be transmitted quicker and quicker (up to a limit of course).
Neighbouring myelin-producing cells, called oligodendrocytes, are the
ones that recognize neurons are repeatedly firing together and wrap
myelin around the axonal wiring.

Myelin is the white matter in your brain and makes up about 50 per cent
of your brain mass. It's laid around your axons a bit like a string of
sausages, and it's thought that the myelin sheath may allow the signals
to travel faster because electrical impulses leap more quickly between
the 'sausages' to uninsulated areas (called the Nodes of Ranvier) than
if the signals just ran from one end of the axon to the other (see
[Figure 11.3](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_Figure_11_3)).

class="referrer" role="doc-backlink"><span class="label">Figure</span>
<span class="ordinal">11.3</span> How myelin affects signal
transmission</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

A study published in *Science* (McKenzie et al, 2014) found that myelin
production was needed for learning new motor skills in mice, but when
scientists blocked the production of myelin after the skill was learnt
it didn't []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_183 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 183" role="doc-pagebreak"}affect the mice's
performance; once something has been learnt new myelin is not required.
At the time of publication the team of scientists at UCL Wolfson
Institute for Biomedical Research hadn't tested whether this process
only affected motor learning or whether it would be the same for
cognitive skills too. This is another example of a lovely piece of
neuroscience that may be representative for all types of learning but so
far, the evidence is only available in the specific condition of mice
learning to run on a complex wheel with irregularly spaced rungs and we
just don't know yet whether it's true of all learning.

Back to the beautiful neuron relationship: when it's meaningful and the
learning is useful for the long term the neurons will eventually make a
[]{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_184 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 184"
role="doc-pagebreak"}commitment to stick together through thick and thin
and it will take quite an effort to disrupt them. Just like a
relationship that's been going on for a long time, if you decide to
split up it can be a wrench. Old habits and relationships are stronger
bonds than new ones and will take a significantly attractive new piece
of learning to come along and disrupt those old familiar bonds.

## [How to build the relationship](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_11_CHAP_C11_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h2_004 .head-a}

To get to this level of connectedness requires time and effort. It's
unrealistic to expect two people to meet, get married the same day and
then have a long and meaningful relationship and it's not much different
for neurons. So, you need to review your learning in order for it to
stick; you need to ensure your neurons meet regularly in these new
patterns for sufficient time to develop the relationship, otherwise
they'll be easily distracted by new, shiny ideas.

You'll find conflicting information about specific times to review
learning but there's sufficient evidence to say that recalling
information and practising skills at regular intervals after the initial
learning does ensure learning is permanent and not transitory. It may be
that some of these meetings need only be brief to keep that flame alive,
but they need to happen.

### Spaced repetition {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h3_002 .head-b}

As you've already discovered in [Chapter 9](#09_CHAP_C09.xhtml) on
memory, specific types of memories are processed and stored slightly
differently. Every 'rehearsal' of a memory embeds it deeper until it's
consolidated and until then learning can easily be disrupted by other
information or experiences. However, all memories, even strong ones are
effectively created afresh each time you remember so there is always
potential for interference.

Stretching learning across time to make it stick for the long term makes
intuitive sense and is backed up by the evidence. Way back in 1885
Hermann Ebbinghaus showed that spacing your learning over a longer time
period is more effective than trying to cram information into a short
space of time. This is called spaced repetition or you may see it
referred to as spaced rehearsal, expanding rehearsal, graduated
intervals, repetition spacing, repetition scheduling, spaced retrieval
and expanded retrieval.

But Hermann Ebbinghaus, and multiple researchers since, were doing
'experimental learning', i.e. learning very specific items in a
laboratory []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_185 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 185" role="doc-pagebreak"}setting which isn't what most
of us encounter in a workplace learning situation. However, despite the
difficulties of doing this sort of research in the real world, there is
sufficient evidence to confirm that short bouts of reviews over a longer
period of time yield far better rewards than trying to revise large
amounts of information quickly. [Figure
11.4](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_Figure_11_4) illustrates how much
more information is retained if you review in spaced intervals.

Fortunately, you don't need to spend a long time at each subsequent
rehearsal of information, though the learning is more effective if you
actively recall information rather than merely recognize it with
repeated exposure. Read on for some practical ways to review learning in
the real world rather than the laboratory.

A study from 2007 by Doug Rohrer and Harold Pashler looked at the
relationship between the time at which you should review what you learnt
compared to how long you want to remember it for. They suggested that
you should review materials at a point which is about 10--30 per cent of
the time for which you want to remember it. For instance, if you need to
sit an exam in 6--8 months then reviewing the material after about a
month is optimal, but if your exam is only 11 days after the learning
session then you should review it a day later.

Their suggestion is that reviewing while the material is still really
fresh in your memory doesn't necessarily work as well as reviewing and
testing yourself at this 10--30 per cent period because the information
hasn't started []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_186 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 186" role="doc-pagebreak"}to get into your long-term
memory, so it can give you false confidence that you really know
something that is still only in a newly-formed state. However, these
results may be the difference between actively recalling to review and
merely revisiting material without active recall and as usual this was
one experiment done in a particular situation. I think the weight of
evidence shows that if you left it for a month before any sort of review
much of that material would already have faded. So perhaps a better
approach is to spend the early part of your time actively recalling and
practising your learning, and review again at the 10--30 per cent
period.

Spaced repetition is one of the best researched, most important
ingredients for effective learning and yet is often left out of the
learning recipe either because people aren't aware of the value, don't
know how to set it up or simply can't find the time or support to embed
it in their learning journeys.

One simple approach often used in language learning is to use flashcards
and there are multiple apps that automate this process.

One of the enormous benefits of learning technology is that it can be
used as a highly effective tool for spaced repetition. Few LMS or LXPs
have automatic spaced repetition built into them but it is possible to
create appropriately timed activities prompting and encouraging learners
to review at key times. You can even do it with automated email though
it can be laborious to set up.

At my company, Stellar Labs, we've designed a spaced repetition
algorithm based on the Leitner system into our personal skills coach
platform.

**Here's how it works**

As people move through their learning journey, they are asked spaced
repetition questions (SRQs) about the key information they're learning.
There are five stages of SRQs. People start at stage one for each
question -- if they answer correctly they move to stage two and so on,
until they reach stage five. If they answer incorrectly at any point,
they are shown the answer to refresh their memory, and move back a
stage. This all happens over time to build neural pathways in their
brains, so they can be confident that the knowledge sticks in their long
term memory.

For a comprehensive review of the research on spacing repetition, look
out for the work of Will Thalheimer (Thalheimer, 2006) who is on a
mission to bring evidence-based practice to the fore.

### []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_187 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 187" role="doc-pagebreak"}Spaced learning {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h3_003 .head-b}

Spaced Learning is a specific form of teaching reported in the *Journal
of Frontiers of Human Neuroscience* by Paul Kelley and Terry Whatson
(2013). Content is repeated three times with two 10-minute breaks in
which students do distractor activities -- often something physical like
juggling. Their method was based on the neuroscience finding that
long-term potentiation starts to happen within minutes when repeated
stimuli are separated by timed spaces; long-term potentiation is the
persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of
activity and is one of the cellular foundations of learning.
Effectively, it's when your neurons are familiar with each other and a
small conversation produces a larger reaction than when they first met.
Think of a really good friend who knows you so well that from a look on
your face they recognize what you need is a cup of tea, a piece of cake
and a good two hours of conversation.

Kelley and Whatson put their spaced learning theory to the test with a
biology course and found that students using this method performed at
the same level as two control groups -- one group using 'one-hour spaced
learning' and the other having a four-month teaching programme. You may
be surprised to read that there was no difference in performance because
if that's the case then what's the point? The obvious implication is
that the learning was much more effective per hour of instruction. This
type of learning has excellent potential for learning information, but
what about skills?

### Spaced practice {.head-b}

Most of what you've read so far has been about retaining information but
what we really want to do is retain skills and behaviours so they are
transferred into the workplace. A classic study from Baddeley and
Longman (1978) showed that spacing skills practice is also highly
effective.

They trained postal workers on a new typing task for sorting mail. This
was at a time when mail was sorted by hand but the Post Office was
moving to mechanical sorting. Ten thousand people needed to be trained
to type so the training had to be both efficient and effective.

A pilot group of 72 trainees were all given 60 hours of typing practice.
But there were four conditions:

- Group 1: trained for 1 hour once a day

- Group 2: trained for 2 hours once a day

- []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_188 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 188"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Group 3: trained for 1 hour twice a day

- Group 4: trained for 2 hours twice a day.

Which group do you predict had the better outcomes?

It turns out Group 1 who trained for 1 hour once a day took fewer hours
overall to learn (approximately 35 hours) compared to 50 hours for Group
4. And Group 1 were more accurate with 80 correct keystrokes per minute
compared to only 65 for Group 4.

The group that spread the training practice out the most took less time
overall to learn and were better at it. So particularly with limited
time available it pays to practise a little each day rather than trying
to cram more practice into a shorter space of time.

### The challenge of reviewing in the real world {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h3_004 .head-b}

Laboratory studies tend to ask learners to learn one specific thing at a
time which is less realistic at work. You might be on an intensive
learning journey where you're going to be expected to make fundamental
changes in multiple things you do and the way you think; you might be on
a workshop for a few days and expect to encounter multiple new ideas; or
perhaps you're doing a short piece of e-learning among your other
activities. Whatever sort of learning you're doing time is precious, and
while you're actively seen to be learning new stuff everyone recognizes
that you're learning, but once it comes to reviewing you might hear
people approach it differently. 'Well that is just repeating what you've
already done'; 'Surely you're a quick learner -- you don't need to go
over it again and again, do you?'; 'That course you went on was supposed
to teach you everything -- why can't you remember it all?'

Training isn't a magic wand. You can't expect people to go on a training
course and then come back 'fixed' or having learnt everything they need
to. As you've noticed while you've read this book, learning is a messy,
lengthy, easily disrupted process and it's hard work for your brain. In
*Thinking, Fast and Slow* (2011) Daniel Kahneman shows us that our
brains are quite lazy -- we don't want to do more with them than we can
help because they are so energy-hungry. Familiarity with material is
your brain's own way of tricking you into thinking you know 'stuff', but
until you've really consolidated your learning -- created networks that
can fire together regularly and efficiently, and built new skills and
habits that become normal -- you haven't really learnt something.

Good reviewing is vital to effective learner-centred training. Learning
might start with e-learning, a virtual reality game or a workshop but it
[]{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_189 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 189"
role="doc-pagebreak"}continues in the workplace over time and it happens
in people's heads and bodies.

A senior learning specialist at Swedbank, Sandra Lace, has been really
excited by the deeper level of learning her participants achieve from
learning in a brain friendly environment and reviewing effectively
before, during and after training events. She had to overcome some
hesitancy among her colleagues who thought that senior managers might
feel 'silly' being physically involved in learning rather than their
standard sitting and listening approach. Her experience has been that
the senior managers enjoy the deeper and richer experience, they value
reflecting and reviewing effectively and they are more open to changing
their behaviours. It's also helped them see the value they bring to
their colleagues in supporting them to review and reflect too. All her
colleagues are now convinced about the benefits of creating a brain
friendly environment and reviewing learning.

## [How and when to review learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_11_CHAP_C11_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h2_005 .head-a}

*Begin* learning with a review of what people already know or can do so
they can link to previous knowledge and experience.

Show people how to create mind maps to brainstorm their ideas. Give each
person time to reflect on and capture what they personally know. Then
encourage social learning to generate more ideas by sparking thoughts
from each other. This often stimulates people to learn something new
from their colleagues straight away -- very rewarding. Encourage people
to contribute to a concept map so that everyone can see all the
information. Do online quizzes/surveys or use message boards to share
current knowledge among people.

As a trainer/designer you now have a clearer picture of the current
knowledge/skill levels so you can pitch the rest of the learning
appropriately to be relevant and personal. It gives everyone a chance to
start warming up those relevant neuronal networks.

When you do this activity it is a review, an overview and a start to
learning at the same time.

*While delivering content* whether face-to-face, virtually or digitally,
deliver it fast and include regular 10-minute review breaks as in the
previous spaced learning example. Have people repeat the content but
encourage them to challenge and explore it, take another 10-minute break
and do another repetition of the content but with the emphasis on
applying the content.

[]{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_190 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 190"
role="doc-pagebreak"}E-learning makes it easy to break information into
small spaced chunks, but you may need a mechanism to encourage people to
take the breaks rather than keep clicking.

*At the end of each activity* encourage people to spend a few minutes
discussing what the exercise meant to them and to capturing their
actions. Give a creative title to reflection time, e.g. Oxygen Check, so
people expect time to reflect.

*At the end of the session* review the whole thing. Encourage
participants to create their own reviews based on the Multiple
Intelligences.

Many trainers swear by slide presentation software like PowerPoint or
Prezi and others just swear about it. Death by PowerPoint is something
no one wants to suffer; however, a concert review is a simple way to
prompt recall.

How to create a concert review

- Use colourful, graphic, low-text slides that you've already designed
  for the training.

- Add text to lead people through the 'story' of the learning.

- Include reflective questions such as 'You now easily recall the
  project management process; what will you do differently?'

- Create an automatic slideshow with a slide transition of about 9--10
  seconds.

- Play some alpha-wave-inducing music and let your participants sit back
  and relax to review their learning.

- Record the whole thing and upload it for future use.

It's amazing how much gets covered and forgotten even in short sessions,
so this is a valuable reminder just before people plan their actions.

*A review at the* beginning *of every module* of a multi-day workshop
will get everyone back into the appropriate state for fresh learning and
after a good night's sleep people are better able to build on what they
learnt the day before.

Remember Hermann Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve (see [Figure
11.4](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_Figure_11_4) [p
185](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_185)) -- if you aren't seeing people the
next day, set up a review 24 hours later because it is a critical period
for memory consolidation. Recreate a quiz or a wordsearch, ask people to
create a flowchart, build a model, discuss their most valuable takeaway,
sorting activities. Put a practice activity in an envelope or e-mail
marked 'not to be opened until tomorrow' and you'll create curiosity too
-- you'd be amazed how keen people are to peek inside those envelopes.

[]{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_191 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 191"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Be creative, create curiosity with different
reviews and give people choices. Encourage people to devise their own
reviews. On modular programmes, there may be a period of one or two
weeks between modules so select a different group each time to invent an
interactive review for everyone else. They will tend to take a lead from
you. If your reviews have been interesting and involving, theirs usually
will be too.

**Top Tip**: Remember that training doesn't always go as planned and, in
addition to the well-planned, lengthier reviews that you design into
your learning journeys, always have a few quick and effective review
methods up your sleeve too.

### Promote transfer and mastery through long-term review and active practice {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h3_005 .head-b}

Most people don't learn for the sake of learning but because they want
to do their job better. Learning is often the vehicle to get them there.
If the learning isn't transferred into the workplace and people don't
master new information or skills they've wasted time, energy and money.

Practice, practice, practice is vital to see a return on that
investment. Refer back to [Chapter 1](#01_CHAP_C01.xhtml)0 for more on
the necessity of practice. Make sure it's scheduled in for people once
they've completed the formal part of a learning journey so they continue
to practice in the context of work.

The evidence for spaced repetition shows these are critical periods for
review that have a long-term impact.

### One week, one month, two months, three months and six months {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h3_006 .head-b}

When you do short activities regularly at these specific time intervals,
retention and transfer of learning is much more likely, which makes
everyone's time worthwhile.

### Use social connections {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h3_007 .head-b}

When we connect socially we release oxytocin, the nurturing
neurotransmitter. As part of the review cycle, reignite those social
bonds and encourage learners to continue to support each other. Use your
internal technology and communication systems to create community.
Create questions and []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_192 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 192" role="doc-pagebreak"}challenges, promote sharing
so everyone can see what other people are doing, for instance:

- What was your key 'takeaway' from the training?

- What's been your biggest success after the training?

- What has started fading from your memory and needs revisiting?

- What barriers have you come across to trying new techniques and how
  have you got round them?

Pick up the telephone to your participants and ask them how they're
getting on -- you'll be surprised how much people appreciate it.
Organize a team call for everyone to share their updates. Upload
supporting materials to discuss. Promote study buddies, action learning
sets or learning cascades.

Use ideas from psychology about social proof -- the idea that people are
influenced by the actions of similar others -- and explicitly tell
learners that most people like them participate in this important part
of the learning process.

### Other vital stakeholders in the review process {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h3_008 .head-b}

Consistently you'll hear the importance that managers play in supporting
learning transfer into the workplace, which of course reflects on the
return on investment in training. What can you do to make sure managers
recognize the importance of transfer and make them a significant part of
it?

Managers are busy people and it's easy for them to imagine that the
training was done by the Learning and Development Department -- you've
waved your magic wand and now it's complete.

Reduce the friction and make it more likely to happen with simple things
like a manager's brief with an overview of the learning highlights. Send
this to the learners and their managers a week before the learning to
initiate a 10-minute conversation about what is expected and identify
ways to apply the learning. Do the same afterwards to remind managers of
their role in developing people -- but make it easy for them. You can't
guarantee they'll sit down and share but you can increase the likelihood
if you make it a simple but required part of the learning process.

Invite managers to a final session at the end of a training programme
and ask the learners to present back what they learnt. This has multiple
benefits, like reviewing the learning, building relationships and gives
learners more confidence to test new ideas back at work because they
know their managers []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_193 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 193" role="doc-pagebreak"}know what their new skills
are. It's sometimes a useful refresher for managers who may have had the
training in the past and sometimes it's a way to give managers training
without them knowing that's what you're doing. They get to learn
something new without having to admit they didn't know.

When building digital learning programmes or e-learning, design an
overview version for managers for similar reasons. Add ideas for them to
support their employees to apply their skills.

Get managers' buy-in by making them feel valued and build their
credibility and authority by making them an important part of the
process.

Being in Learning and Development is sometimes just like being in Sales
and Marketing because you're selling ideas and concepts. Use ideas that
marketing use, like focusing on what the majority of people are doing
rather than the minority. Some managers make excuses about being too
busy to develop their people, but don't worry about them. Instead make
it the norm for managers to be involved by shining the spotlight on
those managers who do support learning in this way -- and tell the rest
of the organization about it. This will create a culture in which
learning thrives and is supported by all and some of those 'too busy'
dinosaurs may eventually join the rest of the pack.

Suppliers and customers can also get involved because they are likely to
be pleased that you are developing your people. You could ask your
learners to feed back to their customers what they've learnt and what
difference they believe it will make to the customer. You'd tell your
customers you had an Investors in People award so tell them about what
you're learning too.

## [Top Tips](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_11_CHAP_C11_h2_007){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h2_007 .head-a}

- Use the multiple intelligences as a framework for reviews to reflect
  different topics and preferences.

- Make reviews short, snappy and regular so that they fire up neuronal
  pathways and make learning happen faster.

- Prompt people to actively review, recall and practise what they learn.

- Schedule reviews to become part of the normal process in your
  organization.

- Educate your learners to know you don't have a magic wand -- it's
  their neurons that need to connect rather than yours.

## []{#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml_page_194 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 194" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Summary](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_11_CHAP_C11_h2_008){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml__11_CHAP_C11_h2_008 .head-a}

This summary is a way of reviewing what you've just read in the chapter
so read it to fire up those neuronal networks again:

- You need to review because memories and skills decay quickly if
  they're not actively kept fresh.

- You're trying to build and maintain a long-term and lasting
  relationship between neurons through improving connectivity.

- Connectivity between neurons is enhanced by myelin -- a fatty, white
  cover around your axons.

- Spaced repetition builds long-term memory better than cramming.

- Active practice and reviews are better than passive ones.

- Spaced learning is a specific way of reviewing and learning
  information -- repeat input three times with 10-minute diversions
  between repetitions.

- Build a culture of reviewing to get over the challenges of reviewing
  in the real world of business -- schedule reviewing to be part of the
  process.

- Review immediately, 24 hours later, one week, one month, two months,
  three months and finally at six months to create lasting long-term
  learning.

- Exploit social connections and involve other stakeholders.

- Help learners learn by explaining what they need to do -- you don't
  have a magic wand.

There's been a debate going on for years as to when people should have
access to 'content'. It used to be whether they should have handouts in
advance. Now it's discussions about at what stage of a learning journey
information is presented. People argue that if the audience has read
ahead they won't pay attention at the designated time. But what does the
research suggest? One study by Marsh and Sink (2009) tested how much
students remembered from a lecture. They received notes before, during
or after their lecture and were tested on their memory of the lecture,
immediately after and a week later. It turns out that test performance
at both tests was pretty much the same regardless of when the notes were
given out -- so there was no advantage to waiting until the end to give
out notes. The researchers suggested that 'students still benefited in
the sense that they reached the same level of learning with less work'.
With many people already having significant cognitive overload, making
learning less work is a positive result.

My view is that we need to treat people like adults and let them make
the choice about whether they want to jump ahead or whether they'll wait
until the scheduled time. Looking ahead may create initial hooks to hang
more complex ideas on as they come to them. So long as the learners
learn what they need it really doesn't matter whether they learn it by
listening to you, watching a video, reading or talking it through with
colleagues. Each exposure to a piece of information increases the
likelihood they will learn it.

As you're probably already aware, stories are great for learning and
there is abundant research showing how stories are sticky. But let's
just unpick a little bit of what goes on in people's brains when they
are have a story rather than just being exposed to facts.

When you experience the world your senses send messages to your brain to
be processed by the relevant areas. When you remember, your brain
obligingly goes off and searches for those pieces of information again
and reconstructs memories in just about the same way so that you can
remember the original event. Similarly, if you imagine something your
brain dutifully marches around seeking out the information it can find
in its memory banks to construct the imagined situation. It's hard for
your brain to tell whether that event is real or imagined which is why
false memories can be constructed and hallucinations seem so real. Later
in this chapter you'll find out about how when you even think about a
sensation, such as texture, your sensory cortex fires up in much the
same way as if you were actually feeling it. In an article in
*Scientific American* in 2014, researchers showed that wrist strength
could be increased just by thinking about moving your wrists (Mosher,
2015). So, a good story can stimulate your brain in a way that a plain
fact or standalone data just can't.

Imagine someone is about to teach a new fire safety policy your
organization has implemented and starts the session along the lines of:
'We're going to learn about the new fire safety policy. It's very
important that you read, []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_198 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 198" role="doc-pagebreak"}understand and comply with
the policy because it saves lives. Here is the policy...' and they show
the new policy on a slide.

How much activity is going on in their audience's heads relating to the
fire safety policy? In the 'Policy only' column of [Table
12.1](#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_Table_12_1), tick off any areas of
the brain that you think will be particularly active when looking at the
policy on a PowerPoint slide.

Now consider a slightly different scenario where you start along the
lines of:

> I'd like to tell you a story....
>
> One Thursday morning in 1952 a French chef, Raymond Lempereur, was
> just putting the finishing touches to a delicious *mousse au chocolat*
> at Croxteth Hall near Liverpool. He found himself recalling his days
> in the French Resistance during World War II, starting and putting out
> fires, when he realized the burning smell wasn't his imagination or
> his cooking. A real fire had started in the Queen Anne wing and he
> immediately ran to the phone to raise the alarm and started getting
> everyone out of the building.
>
> The fire brigade arrived swiftly amid the clanging of bells, the
> frightened shouts of people escaping from the burning building and the
> crack and hiss of the fire itself.
>
> []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_199 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 199"
> role="doc-pagebreak"}The restoration of Croxteth Hall took more than
> 60 years to complete and though Monsieur Lempereur knew it had started
> he sadly died in 2013 so he didn't live to see the new wood panelling,
> new windows, lighting and major redecoration works on one of the
> jewels of Liverpool's heritage. He did know that his quick thinking
> and action had saved anyone from being hurt, the hall from being
> burned to the ground, and meant the priceless collection of 200
> paintings did not get destroyed in the blaze.

As you tell the story show an old black-and-white picture from the
*Liverpool Echo* of 1952 showing a lone firefighter staring forlornly at
a burned-out shell of a building. As the story finishes, show the fire
safety policy slide.

Which brain areas do you think might be stimulated by this story and the
picture? Complete the rest of [Table
12.1](#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_Table_12_1). When you've finished,
read on to see a completed version of the table ([Table
12.2](#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_Table_12_2)).

Clearly this is a simplification of what happens when you see and hear a
story, but it does illustrate why telling stories is so much more
engaging than talking plain facts.

You can use stories for more than just creating greater engagement too
because they have structure. You can use them to help people remember
specific data, especially if you want people to remember information in
a sequence or need to link seemingly unrelated data. The story structure
provides a framework to drop the information into and the more curious,
novel and richly embroidered the story the more easily it will be
remembered.

## []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_200 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 200" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Language and learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_12_CHAP_C12_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h2_003 .head-a}

While you've been thinking about stories let's uncover a few interesting
nuggets about language and some research that's relevant to a learning
environment.

If you do any sort of search on the neuroscience of language you'll come
across thousands of journal articles with increasingly complex and
complicated titles and even more complex and complicated language once
you'd got into the articles. This may be fine for research scientists,
but complicated language is definitely not very helpful for you or your
learners and I'd argue scientists are not doing themselves any favours
if what they want to do is communicate their great research. When you
are designing or delivering learning you want to use straightforward
language so you can communicate even complex information clearly.

So here are five neuroscience nuggets that will help you to make your
language and messages more accessible.

### 1. Keep it simple {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h3_001 .head-b}

While it may be tempting to sound clever and use long words and complex
sentences, people think you're more organized and have a better grasp of
the []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_201 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 201"
role="doc-pagebreak"}facts when you explain things simply. An experiment
in 1978 with students at Bangor University gave them two pieces of prose
to read, both of which described the same information -- but one was
written in an over-complex, highly academic style and the other was
written pretty much as you'd say it out loud (Bardell, 1978; Turk and
Kirkman, 1978). Students rated the writer of the simpler style as more
organized, more knowledgeable and even gave them characteristics that
they couldn't imply from the information, such as they were more
likeable. When you are nervous or less sure of your facts there is a
tendency to talk or write in a more formal and complex way which can get
in the way of your message.

Sometimes people bury important information at the end of a sentence.
Remember how working memory is limited as to how much it can process at
a given time. If you leave the point of your sentence until the end,
your listener or reader has to hold the entire thought in mind while you
get to the point. You tax their working memory. Put the key point first
when you're writing, particularly if it's something that people really
must do. If you exhaust their working memory they may not get to your
important 'must do'. Here's an example of what not to do:

> The first and most important rule of woodworking is to wear
> appropriate safety equipment. While hearing protection is necessary
> for some very noisy tools such as routers and surface planers, and
> latex gloves may be necessary when applying finishes, there is no time
> in the wood shop that you should be without your safety glasses. Put
> them on when you enter the shop, and don't take them off until you
> leave. Your eyesight is too important to take chances.

How far did you have to read before you found out the key message of
wearing safety glasses? It could have been written:

> **Always** wear your **safety glasses** in the wood shop.
>

### 2. Prime the brain with what you want {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h3_002 .head-b}

While we're talking about what not to do, have you come across the
concept of priming? Priming suggests that things in the environment of
which we are []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_202 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 202" role="doc-pagebreak"}unaware can cause us to react
in particular ways; for instance, if you take a warm drink from someone
you are more likely to rate them as a 'nice' person. Sometimes you may
be communicating an unintended message and a simple way to do that is to
use negative language.

How often do you say 'Don't forget to...' or write 'Don't hesitate to
contact me'? What are you really saying? People struggle to process a
negative thought because it makes more work for the brain. Effectively
you have to fire up all the connections related to that word, then
suppress them and while suppressing them you're effectively thinking of
them again until you can replace that thought with something else. But
if your working memory is full of messages like 'don't think of a pink
elephant' then it's not got much capacity left to find something else to
think about.

This next piece of research (Earp et al, 2010) demonstrates that telling
people what you don't want may increase the behaviour you are trying to
avoid. In the study they tested two groups of smokers; both of whom were
asked to look at photos and decide whether they were taken by amateur or
professional photographers. What they didn't know was that the photos
either had inconspicuous 'No Smoking' signs or the signs were edited
out. The presence of the 'No Smoking' sign, whether people noticed it or
not, significantly increased the tendency to approach 'smoking-related
stimuli'. While the researchers stress they need to do more real-world
research it seemed the 'No Smoking' sign was more likely to promote
smoking than having no signs.

Why is this important for you? When designing instructions, tell people
what you want them to do rather than what you're trying to avoid.
'Remember to do your 24-hour review' is likely to be more effective than
'Don't forget your 24-hour review'. If you're teaching something that's
prohibitive are you potentially increasing the behaviours you are trying
to eliminate? What messages may people see at work that are in direct
contradiction to what you want them to learn? How can you constructively
use priming to deliver your key messages?

### 3. Highlight compliant behaviours {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h3_003 .head-b}

It's human nature to notice what's different and what stands out but
sometimes by highlighting the anomalies or pointing out differences you
may be failing to influence the people you're talking to. Anyone working
in training recognizes the challenges of getting people to engage in
training, encouraging []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_203 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 203" role="doc-pagebreak"}managers to support training
and of people ducking out of training when something more 'exciting' or
operationally urgent appears. We often talk about the one person who
left the training rather than the other 15 who stayed. Perhaps drawing
attention to unwanted behaviours potentially makes the situation worse.

Evidence from multiple social science studies shows that we are
influenced to do what those around us are doing. This is called 'social
proof'. Instead of pointing out irregular behaviours, if you highlight
what's working you may be better able to influence people to comply. As
an example, you may have seen notices at your doctors telling you how
many people missed their appointments. These signs are designed to prick
your conscience so you make an extra effort to keep your appointment. A
study with Bedford NHS by Steve Martin et al (2011) of Influence at Work
and BDO showed that notices truthfully highlighting the number of people
who turned up for appointments contributed to a reduction of 30 per cent
in the number of 'no-shows' for NHS appointments and it's been
calculated that this could save up to £250 million if it was replicated
across the NHS. This principle of 'social proof' suggests we look to see
how others are behaving in order to decide how we should behave. In
other words, we tend to follow the crowd.

When you feel included your reward-related brain areas including the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate are
activated, releasing stress-reducing chemicals such as oxytocin, so is
it any wonder we like to be part of the crowd? I know somebody reading
this book will say, 'I don't like to follow the crowd' or 'I like to be
different' and you're right -- some of the time that makes good sense --
but I challenge you to observe your own behaviour and notice how often
you do something because that's the social norm or what most other
people around you are doing.

Back to the language you use: instead of writing e-mails focusing on how
many people didn't complete their training, or who isn't supporting
colleagues, it may be more influential to turn your language around to
focus on the majority of people who are doing the 'right' thing. Publish
figures and tell stories about the higher percentages of people who do
complete their training or turn up on time or managers who make it
easier for people to learn on and off the job.

If you can use statistics then use them, but make sure they are true
because this is about influencing and not manipulating. When you're
communicating with people, think about how you can make them feel
included and release some stress-reducing oxytocin for them.

### []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_204 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 204" role="doc-pagebreak"}4. Say 'Yes' rather than 'No' {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h3_004 .head-b}

Are there particular words to avoid in life? Well it seems that 'no' may
be one of them if you want to help people think better, improve their
cognitive abilities, reduce their stress and improve your communication.
Flashing the word 'no' three times to people in an fMRI scanner creates
a sudden release of stress-producing neurotransmitters that doesn't
happen when they see the word 'yes'. These hormones have an effect on
how well people process information as well as their emotional state. In
their book *Words Can Change Your Brain* (2014), Andrew Newberg and Mark
Robert Waldman talk about the power of positive language to improve
people's thinking, communication and ability to deal with the world.
However, there is a challenge because positive words don't have the same
power to change your brain as negative ones, so you need to use far more
positive words to counteract the negative ones. Based on work from
Positive Psychology, they suggest you need to say at least three
positive things for every negative one, and this includes negative body
language such as frowning as you speak. You might like to try the 'Yes
and...' exercise as a way of practising responding positively rather
than negatively. Work with a partner and whatever they say, respond with
'Yes and...' and build on whatever they say. They then say, 'Yes and...'
in response to you, and so you continue. As an exercise it's great fun
and promotes creative thinking and as a more permanent growth mindset
it's a way of acknowledging the value that everyone can bring to a
conversation.

### 5. Metaphors touch your multisensory brain {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h3_005 .head-b}

You may already be warmed up to the concept of talking in multisensory
language and, if not, you'll begin to see how often our senses creep
into our language. We are so heavily dominated by our senses that they
worm their way into everyday language as sensory metaphors, but also in
the words you commonly see, hear or write. Think about well-known
phrases or sayings you know that are visual: 'Do you see what I mean?'
How often do you hear phrases that are related to sounds? 'Does this
chime with you?' How about words or phrases that are physical and help
you 'grasp' what I'm talking about? Read back through this paragraph and
see how many words I used that have a sensory element to them -- words
like 'warmed', 'talking', 'see', 'creep', 'worm', 'say', 'write',
'chime', 'grasp'. Most of the sentences could have easily been written
using different senses while still conveying the same meaning.

[]{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_205 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 205"
role="doc-pagebreak"}There's now increasing evidence to show that
sensory language may indeed be more interesting and more memorable to
your listener or reader because it stimulates more areas of the brain
than just the language processing areas. Students in an fMRI scanner
were asked to listen to sentences containing textural metaphors such as
'a rough day' and sentences that were matched for meaning and structure
but without any textural metaphor. They took slightly longer to process
the textural metaphor but the areas of their brains that were previously
identified as registering real textural input by touch, the parietal
operculum, showed increased blood flow. When you use multisensory
language you are indeed creating wider neuronal stimulation than when
you use non-sensory language. If wider stimulation helps to create
richer experiences, then you are improving people's ability to learn and
remember by using that sensory language.

This may also help to explain why concrete language is easier to
understand and process than abstract language -- it may actually 'touch'
parts of your brain that usually respond to real stimuli so you've got a
richer picture for concrete language than abstract language which
'floats' with nothing to hang onto.

## [While we're talking about the environment](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_12_CHAP_C12_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h2_004 .head-a}

Do you remember the story about the Truly Terrible Training Course from
[Chapter 11](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml) on reviewing? One of the things we used
to fantasize about in creating a hideous workshop of no value to anyone
was about what would make for a really awful place in which to learn.
You may have worked there yourself. I've seen dark dungeons and tiny
cupboards and been told 'This is our training facility'. There are
trainers among you who have to train in manufacturing areas, on building
sites, on the roads in the middle of the night, in cupboards in retail
parks and any variety of non-specialized training areas. Even our
digital environments vary hugely. Sometimes you really don't have a
choice and yet some people never think to question the venue or the
layout they are given even when they could. There is ample evidence to
show that the environment has a significant effect on how you think, how
you feel and ultimately how you learn. Here are a few thoughts about
learning environments.

### []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_206 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 206" role="doc-pagebreak"}Colouring your judgement {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h3_006 .head-b}

Colour is important and can change our behaviour and our thinking.
Wearing red makes sports teams more successful and can increase their
levels of testosterone, making the wearer feel and appear more
confident. A red environment can reduce analytical thinking, while red
light makes you more aware of your environment and time seems to pass
more slowly when compared to blue light. Warm colours, such as orange,
red and yellow make you think the temperature is warmer than it is and
cool colours tend to make you feel cooler. Green environments seem to be
better for creative thinking and even a view of green plants seems to be
relaxing.

With digital technology we can control the environment we appear to be
in on Zoom calls or teams meetings. You may think the choice makes it
very confusing so decide to choose a white environment to make it
simpler, but that may make your learners simply bored. Perhaps in the
digital world we can think about changing the colours depending on type
of thinking required.

In the meantime, be aware of the colour of the environment you're in
because you may have to do something to work with or counteract the
effect. What's the accessibility like for people with visual or reading
difficulties who can find certain colours or contrasts much more
difficult to process? Neurodiverse people can find backgrounds, whether
real or digital, distracting. It may put them off learning altogether,
make them procrastinate or delay or waste energy in processing
unnecessary complexity.

### Bringing the outside in and taking the inside out {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h3_007 .head-b}

Natural light boosts attention levels, so open the blinds and let the
light shine in. If you can influence the design of your environment,
replace ordinary light bulbs with blue spectrum light bulbs, which are
more like daylight. The best place to get natural light is outside so if
the weather allows you to take people outside then devise ways to learn
in the great outdoors. I have a client who regularly teaches financial
awareness and budgeting in their company car park. Not only does it get
the learners' attention but it also raises awareness of the Learning and
Development team because everyone else in the organization wonders what
they are up to. A view of the outside has been found to make people feel
more refreshed, so if you can't have a real view then experiment with a
background of an outdoors scene; though this is not as refreshing as the
real thing.

### []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_207 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 207" role="doc-pagebreak"}What you put inside you {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h3_008 .head-b}

All types of different nutrients seem to have an effect on our brains
but there are massive amounts of misinformation about which foods are
'good' for your brain and which aren't -- you could write a book on this
alone. Omega-3 fish oils were hailed as the big brain food for a while
but some of the claims made for their effects on your brain seem to have
been overexaggerated and later studies show they may not be quite the
superfood that was originally thought. You certainly need fat in your
diet because your brain is composed of so much fatty tissue: myelin. You
can probably find a claim and counterclaim made for almost any variety
of food you like, some of them seemingly valid and some definitely
financed by vested interests, so when you hear a piece of research I
suggest you go back to those questions you read about in [Chapter
3](#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml) and just ask yourself whether it seems
reasonable. You might even ask, what's your gut feeling about the
research?

Some findings published in *Nature* in 2012 link the bacteria in your
gut with possible developmental changes in brain structure as well as
the processing of neurochemicals (Cryan and Dinan, 2012). Stressed mice
who fed on microorganisms from the guts of relaxed mice showed changes
in behaviour and brain chemistry, and one group of scientists showed
that healthy women given particular probiotics showed small changes in
their anxiety brain circuits. This research is in its infancy still but
could certainly add credibility to some old phrases such as 'food for
thought'.

## [Being exploratory, playful and experimental](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_12_CHAP_C12_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml__12_CHAP_C12_h2_005 .head-a}

You may have heard that creativity lives in the right side of your
brain, but I hope by now you're already seeing that it's very rare that
a single part of the brain is responsible for a particular type of
thinking or processing. Creativity is, like most other brain
'activities', extremely complex and there's far more we don't know about
it than we do know.

When you're being creative it depends on what type of creative thinking
you're doing at the time as to which parts of your brain are playing the
strongest role.

Rather than creativity being located in your right hemisphere, research
now suggests that it's a complex network of activity. We're possibly
using three particular networks when we're being creative: the executive
attention network, the imagination network and the salience network. All
three []{#12_CHAP_C12.xhtml_page_208 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 208"
role="doc-pagebreak"}networks show complex interactions between both
left and right hemispheres, conscious and unconscious thinking
processes, cortical and subcortical regions, and different networks may
be more dominant as you go through different creative thinking states.

Regardless of exactly where creativity happens in your brain, how can
you encourage creative thinking in your learning environments?

Encouraging people to try new and different things helps their brains to
be more plastic and open to ideas, so here is a brief list of things
that have been shown to increase divergent and creative thinking. Feel
free to add in your own:

- laughing

- hugging

- group brainstorming -- standing up

- brainstorming on your own before sharing

- horizontal eye movement exercises

- being bored

- dreaming

- working in a blue office

- walking

- being distracted

- living abroad

- working when you're feeling groggy

- being slightly drunk

- working with new people

- meeting new people

- distancing yourself from the problem

- building on what you know

- playing.

'We have booked the boardroom for your day'

My heart sinks at these words. I ask if the tables can be moved and the
reply is, 'No it doesn't move. It is a beautiful solid oak one-piece
table and we never move it,' and my heart sinks further again. On the
surface of it, what does it matter that the participants will work round
a boardroom table all day? But my experience shows that it does make a
difference to energy levels.

I understand there are many factors that may impact on the energy level
of a group, but in making my observation about room layout I draw on my
experience from delivering one particular workshop for the same client.
They are a national organization and workshops are delivered around the
country at their different sites. The layout, size and flexibility of
the rooms vary between sites. My preference is for U-shape of chairs
with a table in the room for group work. It suits this programme, making
it easy to move around for group work and we can use the floor space for
walking through models and processes.

Sometimes it is not possible to create the layout I want and I have to
work with a room that might be cramped and sitting round tables. I
personally find the lack of freedom to move more tiring and I can feel
my energy levels are lower than when I have space to move and move
around. I have had a sense in the past that participants have felt the
same, less willing to move and 'stuck' in their chair and table
territory. However, recently I was in the same site two weeks in a row.
Having checked the room layout in advance I had been told the large
boardroom table didn't move and worked round it. Despite being a great
group of people they were flagging by the end of the day and comments on
the feedback said the day was too long. The next week I was there for
two days running the same workshop for two more groups, in the same
room. The thought of that room for two days made me determined to do
something with 'the table' and so I moved it to one side of the room.
The difference in my energy levels and those of the group was
staggering. They moved in and out of groups easily, and comments about
the length of the day -- nil!

I am not a musician and have always admired people who can sing, play an
instrument or compose. Music clearly affects our emotions and can be a
useful tool in creating different emotional environments in a learning
situation. What I'd really like you to think about here is how music can
be used to get a message to stick, and at the risk of being really
annoying I'd like you to think about 'earworms'. Which snippets of music
get stuck in your head and go round and round and round until you want
to bang your head to tip them out? What is it about earworms that make
them so 'sticky', and can you use them to help people remember
information? One researcher suggests that it's to do with the length of
notes and the intervals between them that makes them stick. Notes that
are close to each other on the musical scale and then each note is held
for a moment before the next (like the chorus of Abba's *Waterloo*) seem
to be prime candidates to create earworms. So if you're more musical
than me you could experiment with writing short musical sequences with
words to reflect your key learning points and if you play them often
enough you'll have your own earworms. Can you infect your learners with
them too?

Are you aware that you regularly undertake a very risky learning
activity but remain completely oblivious of it? It's usually at night
when you're most likely to put yourself in harm's way and most of us do
it willingly, sometimes desperately waiting for it to happen. From an
evolutionary standpoint it seems very strange that you would stop
keeping an eye out for information about potential food, mates, prey or
enemies and instead shut yourself off from all external stimuli in order
to concentrate only on what's going on inside your head. But of course,
you're not concentrating consciously, because you're sleeping.

While you're asleep you become unconscious of the outside world and for
part of the time not only do you cut yourself off from all potential
warnings of danger, but you are also completely paralysed, becoming
unable to respond to danger, even if you were aware of it.

Every animal on the planet seems to show some form of 'sleeping'
activity, even down to insects and nematodes. How they sleep varies in
terms of length of time, day or night sleeping and whether they sleep
standing up or lying down. There are animals such as some migratory
birds and water-living mammals that manage to keep moving while sleeping
because only one side of their brain sleeps at a time. Clearly sleep is
a universal need but what exactly is it and why is it such a vital
learning activity?

## []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_213 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 213" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Overview -- what you'll cover](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_13_CHAP_C13_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h2_002 .head-a}

You've already read a bit about sleep throughout the book but this
chapter is going to take you on a deeper dive into that strange part of
a third of our lives that we usually pay little attention to -- except
when we're not able to do it.

There's still a huge amount about sleep that is vastly mysterious and
hotly debated. While it's been a relatively underexplored area of
neuroscience there's a growing interest and new discoveries are made all
the time, but as with most of what we find out about our brains research
usually throws up more questions than it answers.

[Figure 13.1](#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_Figure_13_1) presents the
mind map for the chapter. We'll start with defining what sleep is and
isn't and some ideas about the different stages of sleep. You're going
to find out what parts of the brain regulate both sleep and waking, the
neurotransmitters that have an impact and, of more relevance to you, the
vital part sleep plays in learning, particularly memory consolidation
and sense-making.

We'll look at some of the challenges of lack of sleep, particularly in a
modern 'always on' world and the impact that has on effective learning
among both adults and children. You'll find out about napping and
microsleeps and what you can do to work with them rather than let them
get the better of you.

Finally, you will get some ideas to help your learners and yourself to
sleep better. However, this is one area where as a designer or
facilitator of learning you may have less direct influence and it's a
bigger issue for individuals, organizations and educational practice.

## []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_214 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 214" role="doc-pagebreak"}[What is sleep?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_13_CHAP_C13_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h2_003 .head-a}

We all sleep, so have some idea of what sleep is but what do we really
know about it? How is it different to being unconscious under
anaesthetic or because you've been hit on the head? What happens while
you're asleep?

Sleep is different from other types of unconscious activity in that it's
completely natural and is a regular, rhythmic activity controlled both
by circadian rhythms in your brain and body and a homeostatic system of
chemicals. Circadian rhythms (24-hour cycles) occur naturally, seem to
be linked to the earth's rotation and are built into many of your body's
processes. The sleep cycle, like other circadian rhythms, will persist
even without the stimulus of light and dark and the most accurate
estimates measure it at an average of 24 hours and 11 minutes (Czeisler
et al, 1999). Previous estimates were found to be inaccurate because
subjects had access to electric light which prolongs the circadian
rhythm.

The homeostatic system is a balance between a system of wakefulness and
sleep controlled by hormones and neurotransmitters with adenosine
playing a particularly important role in 'sleep pressure'. The evidence
is unclear as to whether homeostasis or circadian rhythms control each
other but seems currently to weigh in favour of the homeostatic system
having more influence over the circadian system than vice versa.
Cortical regions are affected by both systems but sub-cortical regions
are more heavily influenced by the circadian rhythm.

Not everyone has the same requirement for sleep but the data suggests
the average is about 7.5 to 8 hours per day. Matthew Walker in his book
*Why We Sleep* (Walker, 2018) describes long-term studies suggesting
that people, such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, who famously
survived on a few hours each night, may function well in the short term
with reduced sleep hours, but they are storing up problems for
themselves such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease as they age.

Sleep is a multipurpose tool for repairing your brain and body cells,
clearing up debris in the brain, promoting better function and,
significantly for us, plays a huge role in memory and learning. Memories
of what you learn are encoded and recalled while you're awake but sleep
is vital for both consolidating, storing and making sense of what you've
learnt.

## []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_215 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 215" role="doc-pagebreak"}[Stages of sleep](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_13_CHAP_C13_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h2_004 .head-a}

For a long time people thought the brain simply switched off during
sleep and nothing really happened all night long apart from a few
dreams. But in the 1950s, a researcher, Eugene Aserinksy, used EEG to
measure his own son's sleeping patterns and showed that we have multiple
different phases of sleep throughout the night (Brown, 2003). With his
surprising findings, the science of sleep was ignited. (You can read an
excellent full-length version of this story in the *Smithsonian*
magazine.)

Between those first feelings of falling asleep until you wake up again
you go through five different stages every night, which are split into
two categories: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when your brain is at
least as active as during the day; and non-rapid eye movement (NREM)
sleep where it's doing more recovery. You may sometimes find only three
stages of NREM sleep described because the American Academy of Sleep
Medicine (AASM) has combined Stages 3 and 4 but we're going to stick
with all five.

### NREM sleep {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_001 .head-b}

You pass through stages 1--4 of deepening NREM sleep of about 5--15
minutes each and into REM sleep each with a full cycle taking about 90
minutes. Then you start the cycle again, so in a good night's sleep of
eight hours you probably go through about five cycles. However, as with
many things in your brain, it's not as simple as it seems because you
tend to experience more deep sleep (NREM) in the first half of the night
and more REM (dreaming) sleep in the second half.

Additionally, there are significant changes with age; so while a baby
experiences about eight hours of REM sleep at birth, you're probably
having about two hours of REM in your 20s and by the time you're in your
70s you're down to only about 45 minutes. This has an impact on learning
as you'll see when we explore what's happening in the different stages.

During the different stages your brain reveals different patterns of
brainwaves related to different activities at each stage and you covered
them briefly in [Chapter 2](#02_CHAP_C02.xhtml). What do you remember?

**Stage 1 NREM** -- as you drift off to sleep, your brainwaves start to
slow down and you'll experience first alpha and then theta waves. During
this stage you may have dream-like experiences, more like daydreams and
strange illusions of falling or hearing things. These are called
hypnogogic hallucinations. Research from Cambridge University Gates
scholar Sridhar []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_216 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 216" role="doc-pagebreak"}Jagannathan shows the average
person, without any sleep problems, takes between 5 and 20 minutes to
fall asleep (Coughlan, 2018). To help yourself fall asleep more quickly,
create a regular sleep habit with rituals and routines including
reducing your core body temperature before you go to bed.

**Stage 2 NREM** is when you start to generate 'sleep spindles', bursts
of waves with a frequency of about 10--12 Hz that last for at least half
a second (also called sigma waves). They are not clearly understood by
sleep scientists but are very important for learning, especially for
declarative memory; remember that's the sort of memory you can describe
so it's your semantic and episodic memories. It's thought the spindles
correspond to transfer of information from short-term memory in your
hippocampus to your frontal cortex and are important for integrating new
knowledge with what you already know. Sleep spindles increase in
quantity if you've been learning something new and some people suggest
they may be a physiological marker of 'intelligence'.

You'll remember you read about 'WEIRD' subjects for research. Perhaps
they should be called WEIRDM because for much of the earlier research
the overwhelming bulk of human guinea pigs were young male students and
women's results may have been overlooked in the aggregate results.

Women typically have twice as many sleep spindles as men and have an
advantage when it comes to tests for episodic and semantic memories,
smell memories and also memories for faces. Oestrogen seems to increase
sleep spindles and some scientists propose a waxing and waning of memory
during the menstrual cycle. However, more research is required to make
this a conclusive finding.

The number of sleep spindles you experience declines with age which may
be why 'it's harder for an old dog to learn new tricks'. Recent research
has demonstrated that applying an external, oscillating current just as
you enter slow wave sleep can induce more sleep spindles and did improve
declarative memory for a group of students. Perhaps a cure for memory
decline with age is on the way; however, this stimulation was under
closely controlled laboratory conditions so is not to be recommended at
home.

**Stage 3 NREM** is a transition between the lighter sleep stages and
really deep sleep. It's characterized by the appearance of delta
brainwaves which then persist into Stage 4 deep sleep or slow wave
sleep.

**Stage 4 NREM** is when it's hardest to wake someone up but is the
sleep that refreshes you the most and tidies up your brain. Your
brainwaves are at their slowest, breathing slows, temperature decreases.
When experimental []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_217 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 217" role="doc-pagebreak"}subjects are deprived of
sleep for more than one night this is the type of sleep their brains
immediately try to recover.

You can help yourself sleep more soundly during NREM sleep by obvious
things such as reducing noise, having a dark room or wearing an eye mask
and earplugs.

You'll recall that long-term potentiation happens in your synapses when
you are awake; neuronal connections that are repeated become more likely
to fire again. During Stage 4 sleep it seems that strongly stimulated,
potentiated synapses are maintained while weaker ones are filtered out.
It's as if your brain is deciding what to keep and what to throw away.
Some people suggest this is what gives us that 'insight' that often
happens when you sleep. You go to bed puzzling over a problem or feeling
overwhelmed by new information but somehow by the time you wake up it
has started to crystallize and become clearer. It's a time of
'sense-making'.

Another important observation for learning is that the most active parts
of your brain when you're awake also have the highest levels of delta
waves in this stage. If you are woken up during deep sleep it usually
takes a while for your cortical brainwaves to 'speed up' again which is
why you feel particularly groggy and unable to think clearly.

Deprived of this deep sleep, amyloid proteins and free radicals build up
causing damage to your brain and, as mentioned previously, are
associated in the long term with dementia and Alzheimer's disease (Ow
and Dunstan, 2014).

### REM sleep {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_002 .head-b}

REM sleep is particularly related to dreaming and EEG measurements show
your brain is especially active during REM sleep. Most of us dream even
though we don't always remember our dreams. For many years, and still
today, some people believed we could interpret our dreams to better
understand our personalities and deepest thoughts. However, there's very
little evidence that our dreams have any potency for predicting the
future (beyond the consideration that the purpose of memory may be
prediction) or for seeing into our deepest darkest psyches. This part of
your sleep cycle is, however, particularly important for learning
non-declarative skills and habits.

There's a nice story in Matthew Walker's book *Why We Sleep* (2018)
about an insight from talking to a concert pianist. The pianist tells
him that []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_218 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 218"
role="doc-pagebreak"}despite being an expert pianist, when he's learning
a new piece his playing is clunky and deliberate. 'But,' explained the
pianist, 'when I wake up in the morning I can simply play the piece
perfectly.' His brain practises the sequences while he sleeps, enabling
him to express his skills fully the following day.

Normally you have about 20--30 minutes per sleep cycle of REM sleep and
during this phase your motor cortex is as active as if you were awake
and attempts to send coordinated patterns of information to your
muscles. Fortunately for you, your muscles are paralysed thanks to the
effect of GABA and another neurotransmitter, glycine, that need to work
together for the paralysis to be successful. Without this paralysis you
would act out your dreams which can be extremely dangerous for you and
those you sleep with.

The evidence for skills learning comes from many experiments where,
typically, researchers ask subjects to learn finger movements or
sequences and then test them before and after learning. They vary the
conditions so people are either asleep or awake between tests, following
normal sleep patterns and varying the time of day of the tests. Subjects
who sleep between tests always show more improvement than those who
remain awake.

On the face of it, it's not a very interesting skill to learn but of
course most of us use these skills every day when we enter pin codes or
phone numbers. Often when people are asked for a phone number or pin
code they need to 'dial' it with their fingers because the information
has become a non-declarative, procedural memory rather than a
declarative memory. Recently I needed to tell my husband my pin code and
could remember all the numbers but simply couldn't remember the order
until I looked at a card machine. Then my fingers knew the pattern so I
could 'act out' the sequence and give my husband the code. Of course,
you're often practising more complex skills during this important
sleeping stage of learning and it seems that if you practise these
skills shortly before you sleep you're more likely to dream about them
and get that extra little bit of unconscious practice.

## [Anatomy of sleep](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_13_CHAP_C13_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h2_005 .head-a}

At the start of the book you briefly read how various parts of the brain
control sleep and wakefulness and most of the story of sleep is a
balancing act between these different regions and the ebb and flow of
hormones and neurotransmitters. You'll explore it in more detail now.

### []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_219 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 219" role="doc-pagebreak"}Your sleep pacemaker -- suprachiasmatic nucleus {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_003 .head-b}

Deep within your brain is a small structure called the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN) that receives information about light levels directly from
your eyes and acts like the pacemaker for your sleep/wake cycle. It's
buried in the hypothalamus and matches your circadian rhythms with the
light/dark cycle, sending messages on to your pineal gland to produce or
inhibit melatonin.

### Hypothalamus, pons, medulla and midbrain -- keeping you quiet {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_004 .head-b}

The hypothalamus and a group of other sleep control centres in the
brainstem, the pons, medulla and midbrain all have sleep-promoting cells
producing GABA, which suppresses different attentional systems in the
hypothalamus -- this is part of the homeostatic balance between sleep
and wakefulness. During REM sleep it's the pons and medulla that send
quietening signals to your muscles to stop you moving.

### Thalamus -- the gatekeeper {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_005 .head-b}

All sensory information, except smell, is filtered through the thalamus
while you're awake but when you're asleep, rather than being a selective
gatekeeper allowing information in, the thalamus turns into a draconian
night-club bouncer and prevents external stimuli from reaching and
stimulating your cortex. However, this night-club bouncer clearly has
ideas of its own because when you move into REM sleep once again the
thalamus starts to allow sensory information into your cortex, feeding
into your dreams.

### Cortex -- weird dream maker {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_006 .head-b}

Your visual cortex, as you know, is the largest sensory processing part
of your cortex and its contributions to your dreams usually ensure they
are highly visual. However, the frontal cortex is pretty inactive while
you sleep. It's not paying attention to what's logical or real, leaving
you open to accepting the highly improbable events that often take place
in dreams.

### Homeostatic sleep pressure and your neurotransmitters {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_007 .head-b}

The balance between sleep and wakefulness is a delicate one and is
controlled by a number of neurotransmitters that either promote sleep or
wakefulness or sometimes do both, depending on their levels and when and
where they are released (see [Table
13.1](#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_Table_13_1)). Some you've come
across in other parts of the book, particularly when you read about
attention.

### Melatonin {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_008 .head-b}

Melatonin is one of the main neurotransmitters associated with sleep and
is significantly controlled by your circadian rhythm. Melatonin itself
controls physiological sleep measures such as reduced heart rate,
temperature and breathing. It is one of the chemicals people sometimes
take to help them overcome jet lag and is being investigated as a
preventative measure in Alzheimer's disease. Melatonin levels are
inhibited by light so they fall during the day and then rise again once
it starts to get dark. It takes about two hours for them to reach their
peak, sending you off to sleep, and then falling levels during the night
help other brain areas to measure the amount of sleep you've had. Once
melatonin levels are low enough you will start waking up.

### []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_221 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 221" role="doc-pagebreak"}Adenosine -- sleep pressure {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_009 .head-b}

Adenosine is produced by the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
which is a fundamental energy molecule for all your body's cells
including your brain cells. ATP is stored as glycogen in your brain. The
harder your neurons and glial cells work, the more your glycogen stores
are converted to ATP, producing more adenosine. Increasing levels of
adenosine make you feel sleepy -- desperately sleepy. They induce a
pressure to sleep and if you resist it the levels continue to increase
until you eventually sleep. When you go into NREM sleep your brain is
less active than when you're awake so it has time to recover and replace
your glycogen stores and levels of adenosine gradually fall until you're
ready to wake up again.

### GABA and histamine {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_010 .head-b}

GABA suppresses muscle tone while you're dreaming so is important for
keeping you safely inactive and it may also inhibit the production of
histamine, which keeps you awake; so this is a classic balancing act in
the homeostatic sleep mechanism. You're probably aware of anti-histamine
tablets, often taken for allergies, and how they can make you sleepy.
This is because they reduce the uptake of histamine in your brain and
the purpose of histamine is to keep you awake. If you're bitten by a
mosquito at night it raises your histamine levels, so not only does it
itch but the histamine keeps you awake too. In terms of learning,
histamine at appropriate levels promotes learning but higher levels of
histamine can impair memory retrieval. Experiments with rats showed that
high levels of histamine made them less capable of learning to avoid
small electric shocks (Tasaka,1994).

### Galanin {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_011 .head-b}

The role is not fully understood but galanin-producing genes are
stimulated when people are prevented from having REM sleep so it
probably helps to promote REM sleep and may have a role in heat loss;
lower body temperature is associated with better sleep patterns.

### Noradrenaline/norepinephrine {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_012 .head-b}

This is another example of the complicated homeostasis model. We
normally associate noradrenaline with vigilance and high arousal but it
also signals []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_222 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 222" role="doc-pagebreak"}the pineal gland to produce
melatonin. Too little and you don't get sufficient melatonin production
so can't fall asleep; too much and it keeps you awake anyway so it's
another Goldilocks neurotransmitter -- you need just the right amount at
just the right time.

You know the importance of emotions for learning and noradrenaline plays
an important part in processing emotional experiences during REM sleep.
When something unpleasant happens you produce noradrenaline making you
feel physiologically stressed. However, when noradrenaline levels drop
at night replaying unpleasant experiences with these lower levels of
noradrenaline lets you store the memory without the overwhelming stress
that you may have felt at the time. It's not so much time that heals bad
memories but possibly your dreams. People with post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) have been helped to overcome disturbing nightmares with
drugs to lower their noradrenaline levels while they sleep.

### Dopamine {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_013 .head-b}

When this reward neurotransmitter is registered in the pineal gland it
prevents noradrenaline release, reducing the production and release of
melatonin so you wake up.

### Serotonin {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_014 .head-b}

Like many neurotransmitters, serotonin has multiple functions depending
on levels and site of impact. For a start it's one of the precursors to
melatonin so is required for sleep. But when it's at high levels in the
dorsal raphe nucleus in your brainstem it is associated with
wakefulness, unless you end up with an accumulation in which case it
puts you to sleep. You may be beginning to see why sleep research took
so long to take off and is so complex.

### Orexin {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_015 .head-b}

Orexin is another neurotransmitter produced in the hypothalamus and
improves learning and memory potentially by enhancing new neuronal cells
to grow in the hypothalamus. It's been associated with spatial learning,
for which the hippocampus is vital, and improves mood which you already
know supports learning. Curiously, animals with reduced levels of orexin
are worse at associative learning through smell.

### []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_223 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 223" role="doc-pagebreak"}Acetylcholine {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_016 .head-b}

This neurotransmitter is mainly associated with attention and during the
day it promotes the transmission of information from your sensory
cortices through to your hippocampus but at night with falling levels
the information transfer shifts direction out of your hippocampus and
back into long-term storage in your cortex. It's particularly important
for storing declarative memory.

## [Lack of sleep and learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_13_CHAP_C13_h2_007){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h2_007 .head-a}

You've found out about what happens in your brain when you're sleeping
and how it's so vital for laying down memories as part of learning, but
sleep, or more often loss of it, impacts on other aspects of learning.
There has been far more research done on complete sleep deprivation
rather than partial sleep deprivation but as many of us regularly suffer
partial deprivation for a multitude of common reasons that's what we'll
focus on here.

Partial sleep deprivation means losing sleep relative to your normal
amount. Acute partial sleep deprivation is when this happens for just a
night occasionally, as can happen to many of us for any number of
reasons. Chronic partial sleep deprivation is when you continue to do
this for weeks, months or years, which is also worryingly common.

All sleep deprivation impacts on mood, attention, working memory,
decision-making and vigilance. The recovery process for cognitive
function takes longer after chronic sleep deprivation than after acute
total sleep deprivation. Chronic sleep restriction may cause long-term
changes in brain functions that are not reversible and anyone who reads
Matthew Walker's book *Why We Sleep* (2018) is likely to lose at least a
little sleep worrying about the impact of any sleep deprivation.

### Physical and mental energy {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_017 .head-b}

Lack of sleep means lower levels of glycogen and therefore ATP. This is
the energy source of all cells in your body so not only is it harder to
think but even your muscles feel tired. Because your brain uses a high
percentage of your body's available energy, it suffers faster than the
rest of your body. Your frontal cortex doesn't have the energy it needs
for working memory to function so all cognitive tasks are affected and
you may not even be aware of it until you've made noticeable errors.

### []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_224 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 224" role="doc-pagebreak"}Motivation levels {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_018 .head-b}

Your mood is significantly affected by how much sleep you get and you
can probably testify yourself how being deprived of sleep makes you feel
less motivated, less able to think positively, more likely to be
irritable, angry or hostile. And you're more likely to feel depressed.
If feeling this bad isn't enough, sleep loss increases activity in the
amygdala but decreases connectivity between the amygdala and the frontal
cortex so you perceive things more negatively and have less ability to
control your reaction.

Sadly, you will also miss out on the effects of positive experiences
too. Sleep-deprived people are less friendly, less empathetic and don't
feel the positive mood they would normally get from an achievement.
Trying to learn something when you feel like this is just going to be a
lot more difficult.

### Reduced attention {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_019 .head-b}

Everyone knows how hard it is to concentrate the day after a late or
disturbed night. Directed attention is vital for learning and so when
you don't get sufficient sleep, learning becomes harder. Either you miss
information, are poorer at sustaining practice or, worse still, if
you're learning something practical you may make errors or have
accidents due to lack of attention.

Lack of sleep means levels of adenosine are not sufficiently reduced so
you're attempting to stay awake with a stronger sleep pressure than
normal. The likelihood of impaired attention is, not surprisingly,
particularly noticeable when tasks are boring or repetitive. If
something is new or extra­ordinary your attentional mechanisms can
override the sleep pressure.

### Lack of vigilance {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_020 .head-b}

Vigilance is the ability to sustain concentration over a long period of
time and is essential in many technical jobs. When you're learning you
also need to sustain your concentration over time. Sometimes this
sustained concentration, like cramming for an exam, or swotting up on a
new topic, can be what leads to the sleep deprivation in the first
place, creating a downward spiral. The less effective you are at
sustaining concentration the more you're going to do poorly and
therefore feel you need to do more revision or study for longer.
Certainly staying up late cramming for exams is not the way to
[]{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_225 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 225"
role="doc-pagebreak"}embed that information in your brain or to help you
perform well in the exam the following day. And, even if you were to
perform well, your lowered mood level means you won't be able to
appreciate it.

### Access to previously remembered information is reduced {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_021 .head-b}

Much of our learning is supported by building on what you already know
but unfortunately when you're sleep deprived it's harder to recall what
you remembered previously so you are not able to create effective links
to new information.

### Decision-making {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_022 .head-b}

Many learning tasks involve making some kind of decision and being sleep
deprived affects decision-making in a range of ways. You're more likely
to find it difficult to use new information in complex tasks, to have
more rigid thinking and to keep returning to the same thinking or
actions (called a perseveration error). Lack of sleep is also likely to
make your decisions more variable and more risky.

### Microsleeps {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_023 .head-b}

These are very short sleeps of a few microseconds and we're often not
aware of them. But if you've ever driven along a motorway when you're
tired you're sure to have experienced them. You're just as likely to
have experienced them in meetings and I'm sad to say training sessions
too; those moments when you notice you've missed something, perhaps felt
your eyes shut or that disconcerting feeling of your head dropping.
You're more likely to experience a microsleep when you're tired but they
are exacerbated by lack of engagement, boredom, a warm room... sometimes
the conditions associated with a poor training environment or dull
e-learning.

## [Common challenges](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_13_CHAP_C13_h2_008){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h2_008 .head-a}

Lots of people suffer from insufficient sleep, but there are a number of
areas where learning at work and lack of sleep come into conflict:

- People working shifts often have to work unusual hours in order to fit
  into standard training programmes. This is doubly challenging if they
  are []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_226 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 226"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}already chronically sleep deprived (common for
  shift workers). It's the equivalent of asking 9--5 workers to attend a
  training course all night after a day of work.

- Face-to-face training may involve travel for trainers or participants
  and often both. Many people arrive at training programmes at a
  standard start of 9 a.m. saying, 'I had to get up at 4 a.m. to catch
  the early train/plane/bus'. They are not in peak learning condition
  and will find the learning more difficult than their peers who live
  down the road.

- It's popular, and sometimes cheaper, to run training programmes
  abroad, particularly in global organizations. The effects of jet lag
  on learning are obvious to anyone who's flown across time zones and
  it's because your brain is still stuck in the circadian rhythm from
  where you came. If you travelled east you lose time and sleep and it
  takes one day for every time zone crossed to reset your circadian
  rhythm. If you travelled west it takes one day for every 1.5 time
  zones crossed. Most people are probably returning by that time so need
  to reset again on their return. Regular time zone travellers rarely
  function at their best.

- Learning programmes with overnight stays often include elements of
  team building, socializing or networking which can mean a late night
  for participants. This prevents them consolidating what they learnt on
  the first day and makes them less alert and open to learning on the
  second.

- Thank goodness for digital learning, you might say -- no late nights
  due to travel or socializing. However, in global companies training
  often takes place across very different time zones. At a nice easy
  10am in the UK it's only 2am for your San Francisco colleague and a
  late 9pm in Canberra, Australia.

- There are significant differences in sleeping habits of younger and
  older people and typically younger people are more likely to be owls
  than larks. Early starts to school and university days are damaging
  young people's ability to learn. Dr Paul Kelley, who you came across
  in [Chapter 11](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml) on spaced learning, has done a
  huge amount of research on this and his book *Body Clocks* (2018) is
  an insightful read with a strong call to alter school hours and
  business hours. He's kindly given us permission to reproduce part of a
  chapter here as one of our 'Other Voices'.

School start times

The essential problems with early school start times are well known.
Adolescents need anywhere from 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night to
ensure the best health and optimum academic performance, depending on
age and inter-individual differences, yet most get far less. Adolescent
sleep restriction is clearly linked to early school starts as on
non-school days adolescents have woken times two or more hours later.
This finding has been confirmed in Korea, Europe and North America and
is not substantially affected by cultural factors. Why school times
should remain so early is not clear, and there has been little research
into much later start times. A simple answer appears to be to move
school starting times two hours later, but that is only a rough estimate
rather than an accurate proven solution that takes into account the age
of students. This type of solution would require the application of
scientific methods and research in education, which in this area have
previously been somewhat lacking. In 2007, Paul established the UK's
first Trust School, with the aim of translating scientific research into
educational practice using evidence-based methodology. By 2009, the
Trust School's innovative approach to education attracted the attention
of *Horizon*, the BBC's flagship science programme, for their episode on
chronobiology called 'The Secret Life of Your Body Clock'. As part of
filming, Horizon conducted student academic performance tests at 10.00
and 14.00. The students' results were 24 per cent higher in the
afternoon than in the morning. As one student remarked, 'It's going to
affect teenagers all over the world when people realize teenagers learn
better in the afternoon, I don't see why they shouldn't come to school
later too.' The *Horizon* programme, which also made the case for later
school start times, was aired in 2009 and watched by over 2 million
viewers.

Paul was convinced that the school's start times needed to be
considerably later than 09.00. Research into the issue over the previous
10 years suggested that the best solution was probably a core learning
session for all students between 11.00 and 15.00, and then independent
sessions on both sides so that individual students could choose learning
times that were optimal for their chronotypes. His first objective,
however, was to move the start time later for students of 13--16 years
of age. These younger students needed later starts
[]{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_228 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 228"
role="doc-pagebreak"}that synchronized with their biological times,
though not as late as older teenagers. A range of different research by
Roenneberg suggested that a 10.00 start would be most appropriate for
the majority of students of this age, and so to improve students'
health, and after consultation with parents and students, the school's
start time was changed from 08.50 to 10.00.

In the wake of research from the United States indicating that later
start times would improve results, the change was very much under
scrutiny when examination results were announced a year later in 2011.
In the UK, educational success was measured by the percentage of
students achieving good examination scores that met a national standard
for 16-year-olds, covering all the main subjects. Some education
administrators were certain that the results would go down with later
starts, whereas the scientific community was quietly confident they
would go up, as in the United States. Of course, no one really knew.

The examination results went up, but more than anyone expected, with 18
per cent more students achieving the national benchmark for good
results. Many commentators praised the impressive improvement and use of
sleep science to enhance education. A lead article in *The Times*
declared, 'It is heartening to see education responding to the sort of
evidence-based research that revolutionized medicine 100 years ago.' The
changes also brought health benefits, students quickly adjusted to the
later times, and parents were able to see differences in their children.
Liam McClelland, 14, said, 'I'm getting an extra hour's sleep and I just
feel much more awake. I used to be so careless in the morning: really
simple things like when I was pouring milk or something, I'd miss the
bowl. Now I feel happier in lessons, when before I was so tired I used
to rest my head on my hands. I don't get so many headaches either.'

Unfortunately, despite the compelling evidence from this research, and
more, about the impact of a later school time on students' results and
their health, the local authority in this case made a policy decision to
return school hours to normal.

### Naps, sleep pods -- pros and cons {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_025 .head-b}

Some organizations are famed for having sleep pods on site where people
can catch up on some lost sleep. While they are seen as very
forward-thinking, some research suggests they may not always be the
perfect solution. Sleep expert James Wilson in an article in *The
Independent* (Brown, 2018) says installing nap pods is 'one of the worst
things you can do', and can exacerbate insomnia. 'Naps knock bedtime
back. Using a nap pod sounds like the right thing to do, and people are
doing it because they don't know any better, but it's not right for
everyone.'

Other napping research, however, suggests napping is useful for
different cognitive and motor skills. A power nap of only 10--15 minutes
means you stay in the early stages of sleep so recover quickly and feel
rested if you need to do something physical but a longer nap of 50--60
minutes may help 'clear the desktop' making it useful for complex mental
processing like studying. And a full sleep cycle of 90 minutes including
a REM stage will boost creativity and perception. So it looks as if you
need to decide what you want to learn and nap accordingly.

Certainly, if you're feeling sleep pressure a short nap can help to
reduce the levels of adenosine so you function better until bedtime.

There are of course cultures where napping is much more acceptable and
considered normal. When I lived in Spain I enjoyed a regular short nap
of 15 minutes after lunch which perked me up for the afternoon. Try it
out for a week and see how it works for you.

### What can be done at an organizational level {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_026 .head-b}

Organizations need to become more aware of the human cost and the
ineffectiveness of learning when people are tired. Here are some
suggested solutions:

- For face-to-face sessions, make sure people with long journeys have
  overnight accommodation so they arrive fresh or start later in the
  day.

- Split learning programmes into shorter sessions interspersed with
  sleep opportunities -- this is where digital learning to support
  face-to-face sessions is really valuable. For face-to-face programmes
  spread shorter sessions across more days and nights.

- []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_230 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 230"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}When running global programmes group people so
  time zones don't have them rising before dawn or having to stay late
  into the night.

- Shift workers need time to adjust their circadian rhythm before
  training programmes or give them access to learning during their
  normal working hours.

- Create a culture where the restorative value of sleep is valued more
  highly than staying late in the office or responding to messages at
  midnight.

### What you can do to help your learners {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_027 .head-b}

- Teach them about sleep so they can help themselves.

- Plan your training/learning around the types of things you want people
  to learn. It is more effective to have two half days of training than
  one full day, giving people the time to consolidate before learning
  any more new stuff.

- Give people opportunities to nap during learning programmes. Doing a
  guided visualization allows tired people to nap and others to reflect.

### What you can do for your own learning {#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml__13_CHAP_C13_h3_028 .head-b}

There's a mountain of advertised products to help you sleep better and
therefore learn better but many are poorly researched, inaccurate and
may actually cause more disturbance with unnecessary light or sound. A
genuine sleep monitoring experiment in a laboratory to determine how you
sleep will have you wired up to measure at least 20 physiological signs
of sleep which are monitored by experts all night, whereas the sleep app
on your phone is really only able to tell whether it, rather than you,
moved at night.

Sleep is a habit like any other and you can build a new sleep habit over
time. Some of the following ideas may sound like things your parents
told you but 'sleep hygiene', as it's termed, is an important factor in
improving your learning capabilities. Perhaps you won't manage to do all
of these sleep promoting ideas every day but if you're revising for
exams or have something important to learn for work it's worth paying
attention to your sleep for a period before, during and after; giving
your brain its best chance to learn effectively:

- Regular bedtime and waking-up time helps your brain to maintain
  appropriate levels of brain chemicals and because your brain can't
  tell the []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_231 .pagebreak
  aria-label="Page 231" role="doc-pagebreak"}difference between weekdays
  and weekends it's better to keep to the same times all week rather
  than try to binge sleep at the weekend.

- Turn off all blue-light-emitting devices at least two hours before you
  sleep (I know that one sounds cruel -- no mobile, no TV, no
  tablet...). Your devices use short-wavelength-enriched light, meaning
  it has a higher concentration of blue light than natural light, which
  disrupts melatonin levels and reduces the quantity and quality of your
  sleep. You can also buy filters and most modern phones have a
  night-time setting.

- Use special light bulbs designed to mimic the natural light patterns
  of night and day.

- Studies found 30 minutes of blue-light exposure in the morning
  improves working memory and reaction times and can promote sleep later
  -- a walk on a sunny day will do it just as well as special light
  bulbs.

- Reduce your inner core temperature because you'll go to sleep faster
  and sleep more soundly. A warm bath makes the blood flow to your
  extremities, so reducing your core temperature, which is a sure fire
  way to get a better night's sleep.

- Reduce light pollution with black-out blinds or eye masks so that you
  follow the natural circadian rhythms of night and day as much as
  possible.

- Caffeine has an effect on your acetylcholine levels and while it can
  boost cognitive performance in the short term it also disrupts your
  sleep. The half-life of caffeine in your blood is six hours so a
  coffee even six hours before bed can keep you awake.

As you've read this chapter you've learnt:

- Sleep is a natural process experienced by all animals.

- Sleep is divided into five stages of REM and NREM sleep, all of which
  are important for learning, memory consolidation and recovery of brain
  function.

- Sleep is controlled by a complex balance of circadian rhythms,
  neurotransmitters and hormones.

- Numerous parts of the brain control sleep and wakefulness.

- []{#13_CHAP_C13.xhtml_page_232 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 232"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Lack of sleep impacts on learning because of
  changes in mood, attention, vigilance, decision-making, working memory
  and memory consolidation.

- There are challenges for individuals and organizations in learning
  while tired.

Artificial Intelligence is already smarter than humans in some cognitive
domains but usually those AI systems have to be trained for thousands of
hours to get anywhere near to our competence levels. We still have the
advantage that human learning is faster; we can grasp the fundamentals
of new skills surprisingly quickly.

A study from DeepMind (Dabney et al, 2020) has suggested that one reason
we can do this is that dopamine yet again plays a role. It's already
known to strengthen neural connections through reward and motivation.
This experiment with DeepMind appears to show how dopamine, specifically
in the prefrontal cortex, might help us learn new tasks faster.

In the experiment they used meta-learning techniques to train recurrent
neural networks to learn six similar tasks just like the ones in
neuroscience studies -- tasks like monkeys learning to choose an object
based on food rewards. Monkeys quickly learn an abstract rule structure
from the different tasks. Effectively they learn to learn so they can
adapt to new situations.

Scientists trained DeepMind with standard reinforcement learning plus
meta-learning activities which simulate the proposed role of dopamine.
DeepMind was able to learn the 'rules' of the tasks and, just like the
monkeys, adapt to different tasks with different rules. The hypothesis
is that dopamine somehow carries important information about the rules
of target tasks which influences the learning process, making it faster.
Previously AI research []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_235 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 235" role="doc-pagebreak"}has been inspired by
neuroscience, but this experiment means that now neuroscience research
can explore these AI results.

In this chapter you'll explore how people can become more autonomous and
choose what, how and when they learn. We'll look at meta-learning
(learning to learn), the skill that supports all types of learning but
is especially important when there's less structure, scaffolding,
support or external input. We'll look at what L&D can do to create a
culture in which independent learning can flourish.

And some tips to help you successfully learn for yourself (or teach
others).

## [Why do we need to learn to learn?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_14_CHAP_C14_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h2_003 .head-a}

Learning is a natural process and as we've discussed before almost every
living form displays some form of learning; even plants can adapt to the
environment they are in. If it's natural and we've been doing it since
before we were born, and we've survived so far, why on earth do we need
to 'learn to learn'?

### The wider picture {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h3_001 .head-b}

Change forces us to learn so that we can adapt to and survive the change
-- hopefully even thrive in it. With current levels of technological,
digital, climatic and geopolitical change going on there's clearly a
need to adapt regularly to what's happening around us.

An accelerating pace of change forces us to adapt faster and more
frequently than ever before because even new knowledge or skills can
[]{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_236 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 236"
role="doc-pagebreak"}quickly become irrelevant. You'll find plenty of
research and statistics to illustrate the need to learn to learn:

- Linkedin-Learning's annual Workplace Learning report 2022 expects that
  members skills for the same occupation will change by about 40 per
  cent by 2025.

- The World Economic Forum lists 'Active learning and learning
  strategies' as number 2 in their Top 10 skills of 2025.

- *Forbes* magazine lists 'flexibility' as number 7 in their list of Top
  10 Most In-demand skills for the next 10 years and, unsurprisingly,
  flexibility includes 'willing to learn new things'.

Wherever you look, the data shows that those who can adapt, learn and
respond flexibly to change are more likely to be successful in the
future. And those who don't learn will fall behind as their skills
become outdated. We can't afford to let that happen because there's a
growing skills gap that needs to be plugged. Korn Ferry estimate that by
2030 more than 850 million jobs could be unfilled because there aren't
sufficient people with appropriate skills to take them on.

The skill of learning is the gateway skill to all other skills. We need
more people than ever to master new skills effectively, quickly and, I
suggest, enjoyably.

### The organizational snapshot {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h3_002 .head-b}

Many organizations see the value of people learning informally and
formally. Those who are working towards mature learning cultures
regularly talk about creating a self-directed learning workforce. They
genuinely want their colleagues to be able to learn for themselves,
when, where and how they prefer -- but it also needs to deliver results.
As well as the factors already mentioned there are other forces driving
a more diverse and blended approach to learning:

- Flexible working means people aren't always in the workspace together.

- 'Just in time' learning has taken over from annual, programmed
  schedules.

- Personalized learning -- people with different prior experience or
  future needs don't want to follow the same path.

- Global organizations struggle to have relevant people available across
  the same time zones.

- []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_237 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 237"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Access to relevant information or content is
  available at our fingertips.

- What would you add from your organization's perspective?

A strong reason to empower people to learn to learn is the
over-abundance of content. Many organizations have tackled modern
learning challenges by making multiple training courses easily available
through LMS, LXPs, MOOCs, etc. Plus, they provide access to increasing
numbers of external tools; for example, the number one tool for learning
in Jane Hart's annual survey Top 100 Tools for Learning 2022 was
YouTube, again.

More often than not, we're feeding people content and if you've read
this far through the book you already know that content is only a part
of a learning journey. Content alone will not rewire those neural
pathways to change behaviours and develop skills. People need to be able
to move from 'knowing' to 'doing' and watching a video, listening to a
podcast, doing some e-learning or reading a document is insufficient.

However, if people know how to get motivated, chunk content, remember
it, test themselves, recall, reflect and apply the content, to practise,
get feedback, space their repetitions, share, teach and reflect on their
performance then the content begins to take its rightful place of
kickstarting a learning journey, but it\'s not enough alone.

### The people's perspective {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h3_003 .head-b}

What's it like from your personal perspective? Do you feel sufficiently
equipped to learn new skills effectively? Do you want to learn to learn
better? Or do you simply want to do your job better and learning is just
a way of getting there? Most people, in a work context at least, don't
learn simply for the sake of it but because they want to get things
done.

It's challenging to get people to sign up to learn something when they
can't see an immediate need or obvious impact. Learning to learn tends
to fit into Steven Covey's 'important, non-urgent' quadrant. That is,
you know it's a good idea, but the pressure is rarely high enough to do
it today.

Or are you one of many people who are actively learning to learn?
According to data collected at Class Central the fourth most popular
online course at Coursera is Learning How to Learn, designed by the
marvellous Barbara Oakley. According to Coursera, they've had 2.7
million enrolments with an average completion rate of 55.4 per cent.
Many other learn to learn opportunities are also popular, so there's
clearly a group of people who see how well-honed learning skills make
learning everything else more effective.

Let's start with defining a few terms you may hear. The major difference
between the terms seems to be the domains they come from.

**Pull versus push learning --** traditionally, learning at work has
tended to be push learning -- you learn something because someone else
thinks it's a good idea and information is pushed at you. But as
organizations change there's increasing emphasis on 'pull' learning
where people choose what, where, when, how they learn rather than
relying heavily on 'the training department' to deliver training to
them. It's more natural and people are more inclined to be motivated,
engaged and sustain the journey when they have the autonomy to make
choices. But as you'll read shortly, it can be hard to learn on your
own.

**Self-directed learning** -- Myriam Neelen and Paul Kirschner in their
book *Evidence Informed Learning Design* describes it as 'a
meta-cognitive process in which learners take the initiative to diagnose
their own learning needs, formulate learning goals for themselves,
select learning tasks, perform those tasks and evaluate their
performance'. You might hear them say, 'I can choose what I learn and
how to learn it.' You might hear it referred to both in andragogy (adult
learning) and pedagogy (children's learning) and it's originated from
the formal and academic learning domain.

**Self-determined learning** (also termed **heutagogy**) is similar in
that people make choices about what and how they learn but the key
differences are a focus on the process, on problem-solving strategies
and reflection on the learning process itself. A person might say, 'I
will learn X and I'll reflect on how I learnt X in order to improve the
learning process for next time.' It incorporates the idea of double loop
learning (Argyris) and learning how to learn.

**Autonomous learning** was first coined by Henri Holec (1981), a
language learning specialist, as the 'learner's ability to take charge
of his or her own learning'. It seems similar to self-determined
learning and it may simply be the language learning domain that's
different. However, it's a term you'll hear regularly.

**Self-regulated learning** is more personal to the individual and
focuses on internal regulation and control during a learning activity. A
person might say, 'I will pay attention to get this exercise finished.'

**Agile learning** -- an approach to learning with a focus on continuous
and incremental learning with a focus on speed, collaboration,
reflection and iteration.

## []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_239 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 239" role="doc-pagebreak"}[It's sometimes hard to learn on your own](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_14_CHAP_C14_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h2_005 .head-a}

Despite the vast amount of information available much of it isn't
designed with effective knowledge acquisition in mind, let alone skill
building. You'll have experienced it yourself: complicated texts, dull
webinar recordings, boring presentations, instruction manuals with no
pictures, e-learning that you can just click through. You can access all
the information but it's not necessarily easy to process and there may
be no immediate connection with what you need to do with it.

Here's a story of a student with a genuine desire to learn who got lost,
simply because she didn't have an appropriate strategy to tackle too
much complex information.

Julie Delhem was a veterinary student in her third year of university
who was excited about wanting to work with animals but felt overwhelmed
by the academic study. 'I couldn't get the information in my head and
wasn't making any connections between one chapter and the next,' let
alone with her long-term goal to become a veterinarian. The mounting
pressure of exams was taking its toll and she was stressed and not
sleeping. She asked me for some coaching to help her learn to learn.

Step one was to find her motivation and identify any elements of her
learning she did enjoy. 'Anatomy', came the answer. 'I like drawing
animal anatomy.' With this in mind, Julie started to explore information
visually in other areas of her studies.

'For example, when we had to study bacterial diseases in food we had
pages and pages of text. I drew an apple to represent food and added a
worm to show disease, then reconstructed the text around it.' She also
used colour coding for her text because that helped her recall the
information at exam-time. This habit of processing text, breaking it
into short, colour-coded blocks and adding a graphic element proved to
be a breakthrough.

Feeling more confident, she also used the strategy of explaining the
information to her best friend who knew nothing about veterinary science
but was happy to help. By explaining in a way he could understand, she
began to identify the elemental skeleton of the information rather than
feeling overwhelmed with the cognitively overloading content.

You'll be pleased to hear, in contrast to her initial expectations,
Julie passed her exams with flying colours -- literally.

As Julie learnt about veterinary science she also learnt strategies to
help her learn more effectively. That's a skill she can take with her
wherever she goes in the future.

[]{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_240 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 240"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Important note: this story is not an example of
learning styles. Julie used multiple strategies to process and learn the
material she was struggling with. The key was finding something
motivating to get her started and give her the confidence to take her
own path.

## [What is learning to learn?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_14_CHAP_C14_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h2_006 .head-a}

Think about top athletes. Not only do they have all the best equipment,
coaches and support teams but they also spend huge amounts of time
practising their specific sports skill. They actively observe, reflect,
practise, develop and improve their basic skills to achieve mastery. So,
if we're to solve business and organizational challenges, fill skills
gaps and create organizations that are innovative and high performing we
need self-directed, self-regulated, self-determined learners who can do
the same and actively use relevant strategies and tools to move from
novice to expert, or expert to mastery.

One of the challenges of the learning profession is that we don't have
one, single body defining the parameters of our roles, so we often end
up with lots of ways of saying the same thing but in different contexts.
So we'll define some more terminology you may hear before we move to the
practical aspects.

**Learning agility** is often cited as a top skill for the future. It's
more likely to be associated with learning from experience than formal
learning and stresses the requirement to reflect on your experience and
actions and then apply to new situations in order to build new skills.
It's got strong connections with the 'agile working' domain and is
another way to describe the ability to learn.

**Meta-learning** is a phrase from the field of psychology and is a
branch of metacognition. Metacognition is when you reflect about what
you're thinking or doing. So meta-learning is learning about your own
learning processes. Meta-learning is regularly referred to in AI circles
where automatic learning algorithms learn from other learning
algorithms.

**Learning to learn** -- I called this chapter 'learning to learn'
because it seems the simplest way to describe it -- it does what it says
on the tin.

The definition from UNESCO's International Bureau of Education (2022) is
'\[a\] lifelong process in which individuals deliberately or intuitively
plan, monitor and adapt their learning. When individuals learn to learn
they treat learning activities as objects of inquiry, personal
reflection and self-analysis.'

[]{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_241 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 241"
role="doc-pagebreak"}This definition suggests the process can be
deliberate or intuitive but to improve your intuitive learning you
usually start with being deliberate.

Noel Burch's The Stages of Competence model helps to illustrate this
transition (Broadwell, 1969). I'll use the example of driving because
most of us recognize the experience.

When you're a child you sit in the back of the car and imagine you can
drive -- it's just a case of turning the steering wheel like your mum
does. You're **unconsciously incompetent** -- you don't know that you
can't drive a car.

The first time you get in the car to learn to drive for real you quickly
realize that there's a lot more to it than just steering. You are now
**consciously incompetent** and feel the urgent need to learn to steer
properly, change gear and brake. By the time you pass your driving test
you're **consciously competent** -- you know you can drive well enough
to be allowed on the streets alone, but it still takes serious
concentration because there's all the distractions of other traffic,
street signs, new routes, etc. Until, one day you realize you've arrived
at your destination and were so busy thinking about your day at work
that you didn't think once about changing gear, steering or braking. You
might not even be aware of whether you drove through red or green
traffic lights. You're now **unconsciously competent** because you can
do the skill without focusing on it.

It's easy to move back a step if you change to a different car or learn
to drive on the other side of the road. Suddenly, you need to think
consciously about what you're doing again until the new habits become
natural (refer back to [Chapter 10](#10_CHAP_C10.xhtml) if you want to
remind yourself about habits). The helpful thing is the old habits are
still there so what you've done is build a skill that crosses into
multiple domains or contexts -- sometimes called 'far learning'. You've
mastered a skill when you can apply it in multiple ways and adapt
quickly to new circumstances.

Learning to learn is something you are probably unconsciously competent
at -- you've managed to learn many things and have been guided or have
worked out how to do it a particular way. But just like driving a car
you may have learnt some bad habits or maybe the context or
circumstances have changed. To master the skill you need to become
consciously competent again so you can identify and eliminate poor
habits and continue to improve your strategies.

Occasionally some people object to the term 'learning to learn' because
they believe they already know how to learn. I tend to quiz them gently
to find out how much they are able to reflect on their own learning
strategies []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_242 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 242" role="doc-pagebreak"}and whether they are
susceptible to learning myths. This attitude is an example of a fixed
mindset because learning to learn, like any skill, is a continuous
journey of improvement.

Fortunately, there's hope for us all: 'old dogs **can** learn new
tricks', if they choose to.

## [What does the science say about learning to learn?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_14_CHAP_C14_h2_007){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h2_007 .head-a}

You've already discovered plenty about the science of learning that you
can apply to learning to learn. But is there anything different or
additional in the science of 'learning to learn' as opposed to learning
about something?

There do seem to be some factors that have particular relevance for
learning to learn.

**Self-regulation** -- you read a little about self-regulation earlier.
One of the challenges of learning is it takes time -- it's energy
consuming and can be []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_243 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 243" role="doc-pagebreak"}hard work and therefore it's
easy to be distracted. It turns out that people who are good at learning
are better able to self-regulate and keep themselves on track, even when
the going gets tough. Self-regulation is largely the work of our energy
hungry pre-frontal cortex which continually attempts to regulate the
amygdala and reward centres like the striatum which releases dopamine.
Experiments have shown that stimulation of the pre-frontal cortex has a
positive impact on persistence, delayed gratification behaviour and
impulse control (Kelley et al, 2019).

**Self-fulfilment** is something we can feel both as we're learning and
when we've reached a learning milestone. Once you recognize that
learning is a process rather than a goal to be achieved the process of
learning itself becomes its own reward -- it's intrinsically rewarding.

Think back for a moment about how you learnt when you were young.
Children don't play to learn; they play because it's fun and they
usually stop when it becomes boring. One of the features of play is it's
unpredictable and we know when we learn something new a release of
dopamine signals unexpected reward. When we perceive that what we're
learning is useful our attention is locked onto it by that dopamine
reward. The implication is if we do things that are enjoyable but
non-predictable we are more likely to persist and learn from the
experience (Herd, Mingus and O'Reilly, 2010). Basically we should play
more to feel more self-fulfilment.

When we recall a memory it seems it is the emotion we recall first which
then triggers connections to the other information that has been
associated with it. When training is information heavy with no
associated emotion then it may be harder to recall. It is potentially
challenging for work-based learning with a strong emphasis on
information and facts and sometimes a resistance to the emotional
context. Connecting emotions to information is another reason why play
can support learning.

**Reflection** -- pretty much all the research on learning to learn
demonstrates the value of reflection before, during and after a learning
episode and you can refer back to [Chapter 11](#11_CHAP_C11.xhtml) for
more on how review and reflect. One of the challenges of self-reflection
is that it stops you getting on with the job in hand, which is often why
it's neglected in favour of operational priorities. Our desire to meet
goals, be successful, get the job done can override the slower, less
immediately rewarding process of reflection.

While we're focused on a task, areas of our brain that make up the 'Task
Positive Network' (TPN) are particularly active:

- []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_244 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 244"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Lateral prefrontal cortex -- responsible for
  cognitive control and includes working memory, attention selection and
  planning; all processes which are affected by reward.

- Anterior cingulate cortex -- involved in emotion, attention,
  anticipating reward, decision-making, error detection and impulse
  control.

- Insula -- has multiple roles including sensory processing, motor
  control, self-awareness, decision-making, emotion, immune system
  regulation, pain, conscious desires and cravings. It may be that it's
  particularly valuable for facilitating self-awareness in the moment
  (Craig, 2009).

- Somatosensory cortex -- enables you to feel great or awful because it
  processes all your bodily sensations.

These activities are all vital to you being able to do a task and stick
to it. You might even notice that there's quite a lot of reward involved
in performing a task -- we really do like to get things done.

When we reflect, we tend to move into a pattern of brain activity where
the Default Mode Network (DMN) takes over. While there is not full
agreement about what structures are included in this network it
generally includes:

- Medial prefrontal cortex -- attention, inhibitory control, habit
  formation, memory

- Hippocampus -- memory processing

- Amygdala -- negative emotion

- Posterior cingulate cortex -- is activated by emotional stimuli and
  plays a part in internal thought, self-reference, autobiographical
  memory recollection, mind wandering and it's been implicated in
  numerous disorders including autism, depression, ADHD

- Inferior parietal lobe -- perception of emotions, interpretation of
  sensory stimuli, language, maths and body image

This network is particularly involved with thinking about others and
yourself, remembering the past and planning for the future.

Usually, the two networks operate in harmony so that as you switch
between focusing and reflecting, activity in one goes up while activity
in the other goes down. You can encourage DMN-type thinking with
mindfulness or daydreaming, for instance, or asking reflective
questions.

In people with ADHD it seems the DMN may remain active while the TPN is
also active, creating a persistent distraction from the task in hand and
often leading to negative thoughts. One way that works for some people
[]{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_245 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 245"
role="doc-pagebreak"}to deal with the challenge is to find a focus to
switch back to TPN; even concentrating on breathing may help.

Unless we're philosophers, at work we're mainly rewarded for being busy
rather than sitting gazing out of the window. So, we tend to get on with
tasks and thus reduce the opportunity to reflect, to learn from our
experiences and to learn from the experience of learning itself. If we
want to learn to learn we must develop the habit and take the time to
reflect. We need to educate our colleagues and communities that what
we're doing is not wasting time but potentially making the best use of
our time by learning to avoid the same mistakes again and again. One way
to do this is to actively signal reflection time -- whether that's in
meetings or simply while working alone. Encourage people to make it part
of their daily processes.

## [**Traps to avoid in learning to learn**](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_14_CHAP_C14_h2_008){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h2_008 .head-a}

While I advocate learning to learn as a very valuable skill there are
some easy traps we can fall into whether we're learning to learn for
ourselves or supporting others.

- One of the biggest challenges is we don't know what we don't know --
  we're unconsciously incompetent. Unless our awareness is raised we are
  unlikely to take the required action, which is why feedback and
  curiosity are both helpful because they raise our awareness and
  increase our motivation to change. In the context of learning to learn
  we may not be aware that there are more effective strategies available
  to us unless we do some additional work to find out.

- Have you heard of the Dunning Kruger effect, where we believe we're
  smarter than we are? It's a cognitive bias when you have low ability
  or experience in a particular task or knowledge area (true for all of
  us) and we tend to over-estimate our own ability or knowledge. In the
  context of meta-learning it can prevent us from being curious to
  explore more about better learning processes and strategies available
  to us. Even being aware of the bias is a useful spur to become more
  curious.

- Both of these relate to the quite reasonable belief that we think we
  know how to learn. But there's a reason people take advanced driving
  courses, for instance -- they can already drive but maybe not
  optimally, or they want to know how to drive in new conditions or they
  need to remove some bad habits.

- []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_246 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 246"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Many people still believe in persistent learning
  myths that lead them to waste time and energy on ineffective activity.

- Making it boring -- even learning to learn can be boring if you choose
  a sub-optimal way to learn the skill. There are some surprisingly dull
  books and videos out there on learning to learn, so choose your
  learning journey wisely.

## [L&D's role in learning to learn](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_14_CHAP_C14_h2_009){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h2_009 .head-a}

From an L&D perspective we need to talk less about learning and more
about how we support 'doing'. In his book *How People Learn*, Nick
Shackleton-Jones describes how L&D would benefit from 'eliminating
learning' and focus on improving performance. He's not saying we need to
avoid learning altogether but we need to make it easier for people to
learn while on the job. He's certainly not the only person to call for
this focus on learning in the flow of work.

### Supporting others to learn to learn {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h3_004 .head-b}

If you are supporting others to learn to learn, a number of studies in
the education sector found there were four general aspects to teaching
metacognition which can equally be applied to meta-learning.

Step 1: Promote an **awareness** of the value of learning to learn
because you want people to become conscious about what they usually do
unconsciously. Help people see that learning is a skill to improve
rather than an instinct or natural talent. Encourage people to become
curious and watch how they learn themselves, whether they succeed or
not:

- Observe patterns in what they actually **do** to learn -- and the
  results.

- Assess their own motivation levels or attitudes to different
  strategies.

- Find their peak times for different activities.

- Look at the context -- does it change the result?

Step 2: **Model** learning techniques so they become explicit:

- Explain how you're facilitating, coaching or teaching and why.

- Ask people to answer 'why do you think I decided to do it this way?'

- []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_247 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 247"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Encourage people to observe the learning
  strategies of colleagues.

- Scaffold learning -- promote the use of job aid, cheat sheets,
  checklists and share them.

Step 3: Encourage people to move beyond awareness to **action**.
Learning to learn can be cognitively challenging and initially takes
time and effort. You need to help people see that it's normal to need
practice (like riding a bike or learning a new language) and reflection.

- Map an improvement plan.

- Allocate specific time to develop new learning strategies.

- Adopt specific strategies to improve note taking, memorizing,
  self-testing and reduce procrastination.

- Encourage people to 'work out loud' as they do things from which they
  learn.

Step 4: Work on the learning culture, environment and eco-sphere so that
**learning becomes work** and work becomes learning.

- Involve senior people and ask them to 'learn out loud'.

- Recognize and reward the process of 'mastery' rather than performance.

- Signal learning is happening -- like wearing an L plate while learning
  to drive.

- Build in self-learning reflection points to all formal learning
  opportunities so people get used to learning about learning while
  learning other things.

### You already have a learning culture! {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h3_005 .head-b}

When Marc S. Ramos was Head of Learning at Novartis I asked him for his
views about building a learning culture and he told me that every
organization already has a learning culture, even if it's just a shelf
of old books, but the difference lies in how effective yours is.

Successful organizations have a mature learning culture where learning
and work intertwine and people are capable of learning for themselves.
If you're interested in benchmarking your learning culture take a look
at the Learning Performance Benchmark (formerly Towards Maturity) which
has a rich database to compare against because Laura Overton started
collecting data back in 2003. It's now in new hands but still full of
valuable insights to move yourself along that maturity scale.

### []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_248 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 248" role="doc-pagebreak"}What makes for a mature learning culture? {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h3_006 .head-b}

With our clients at Stellar Labs, we use an evidence-based model for a
learning culture where different strands interact to ensure everyone's
time is well spent on efficient, effective learning that changes
behaviours, builds skills and delivers organizational impact.

Learning starts with **people** because it's learners' brains and bodies
that change as they work and learn. It's not just the learners you need
to work with but all the stakeholders that support the change and create
the environment in which learning can flourish. As always, managers have
a strong role to fill here.

With a **science**-based approach to learning you can have confidence
that learning has the best chance of transferring into the workplace and
creating an impact because time, money and energy are not wasted on
ineffective activities.

**Process** gives you the opportunity to scale, to be consistent and to
be efficient. Processes need to be adaptable and flexible enough to work
in different contexts but robust enough that you can analyse the process
regularly for continuous improvement.

**Technology** is a learning enabler when it's robustly designed with an
evidence-based learning process behind it. Some technology is
over-focused on features and smart technology but it doesn't necessarily
provide the best learning experience for the users or deliver results
for the organization.

Technology definitely adds value by collecting relevant **data** that
becomes information and then insights to educate and inform us where we
are, what we need to change and how well we are progressing.

When clients ask where they should start, we don't prescribe one place
or another but advise them to build on where they have strengths. Having
said []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_249 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 249"
role="doc-pagebreak"}that, increasingly, many of them recognize that
they don't have the data they need to show value to the rest of the
business. This often prompts them to start to measure where they are now
and identify where they want to go. This goes way beyond happy sheets
and means you have to look at how learning is transferred into work and
the impact on the business. You need courage and curiosity because it
can be challenging to look yourself in the eye and see that what you've
done so far may not have been the most effective. What our clients find
is that building a data strategy and collecting data kickstarts the
change process because they can take incremental steps, measure the
impact and identify actions to keep moving. They have data and more
credibility to discuss options with decision makers.

### Practical examples of a curious culture {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h3_007 .head-b}

Many organizations are currently trying to develop a learning culture
that encourages people to learn under their own steam rather than always
looking for formal learning opportunities. At least two big
pharmaceutical companies have chosen to do this by heavily promoting
'curiosity' with their employees.

Novartis started a global Curiosity Campaign where they encouraged
everyone in the business to participate in short learning activities
over one month. They created a lot of hype and treated it very much like
a marketing campaign. It was successful in raising awareness about what
was already available to people but also they were able to gather data
about what else was needed. As an organization with a strong research
culture they found some teams were already self-directing their own
learning more than others. They introduced a 100 hours annual learning
goal for everyone but were not prescriptive about how they learnt and
created mechanisms for people to share, contribute and add to the
collective insights.

In a conversation with Anne Barre at GSK she explained they also chose
curiosity as a focus because the starting point for learning is
curiosity. They created a specific campaign to give people time and
space to be more curious and believe this will spill over into normal
business. Currently they strongly encourage everyone to schedule a
minimum of one hour per week, with their managers' support, to devote to
learning. They've also introduced a 'curiosity shades' profile tool so
people can check how far along a curiosity scale they are. Thinking out
of the box is encouraged with specific ideas like going to another
department to ask questions about their jobs -- whether it's relevant to
your own job or not. Longer term results are still emerging but
[]{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_250 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 250"
role="doc-pagebreak"}the snowball effect seems to be changing some
teams' attitudes from 'I've done this job for 20 years so why change' to
one where people are prepared, for example, to test out VR and even ask
for more!

This doesn't mean every organization has to start with curiosity but it
does seem to be a growing trend.

## [GEARing up to learn to learn](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_14_CHAP_C14_h2_010){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml__14_CHAP_C14_h2_010 .head-a}

Skills can be acquired through long experience -- sometimes beautiful
and sometimes bitter -- but you can speed the process up by learning
valuable strategies, tools and techniques to make more efficient use of
those experiences so that every minute spent learning is worth it.

While few people and organizations seem to be prepared to give up long
periods of time to learn to learn it's valuable to offer information,
guidance, support and options to raise awareness and avoid some of those
traps you saw earlier.

Remember that those people who are already successful -- the talented
and the high-fliers -- have probably already developed useful skills and
strategies that work for them. Learning to learn can often offer most
value to those who struggle or are disengaged from the usual learning
offerings.

One of the clearest findings from learning research is that novices
require different approaches to experts. Novices, or the newly
consciously aware, need more structure and guidance -- often called
scaffolding -- to support them in the learning process. So, use a
practical model of learning they can work with.

Here's a refresher of the GEAR model from the point of view of a
learner:

Work your way through the GEAR model in iterative loops remembering to
space your learning rather than cram it.

Fuel your journey to successful '**transfer**' by deciding which stars
you want to reach; i.e. what do you want to be able to do (define
transfer objectives)? What are the steps to get you there (learning
objectives)? How do you want to feel as you travel and when you arrive
(affective objectives)?

These personal goals kickstart your **motivation** -- the desire to do
something new drives our need to learn. Build a structured journey with
milestones and commit to and track your progress because visible
progress is motivating. Look for supporters who can travel with you or
give you a []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_251 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 251" role="doc-pagebreak"}hand when you need it. And
there's no reason you can't reward yourself along the way.

**Guide** -- find guides who can point you to relevant information and
experiences and break the information into digestible chunks along the
journey. But don't gorge on information simply because it seems
interesting and you feel confident you're learning -- beware of that
forgetting curve. Remind yourself that by the end of this journey you
want to do rather than simply know.

**Experiment** early to see how you can connect this new information
with your world. Get curious and ask questions, make hypotheses, look at
it from different directions, practise in safe situations, try different
strategies, ask for feedback, test yourself -- can you remember what you
just learnt? If you make mistakes, what can you adjust or change?

**Apply** -- flex your new skills by finding opportunities to practise
in the workplace, ask colleagues for their opinions, try a part of what
you're learning, or have a go in a new context, use checklists, let
people know you're learning, fail and learn from it, succeed and
celebrate.

**Retain** -- test yourself regularly at spaced intervals to remember
information for the long term and practise repeatedly until you are
confident you have a new habit. If you forget and return to previous
habits then just try again. Keep your eye on your progress and goals to
keep your motivation up. Ask for support to help you transfer new skills
into your environment. Remember how neuroplasticity is your friend but
you have to work at it.

Earlier I mentioned that learning to learn can be challenging in busy
operational organizations where pressure is on to get jobs done and
products out of the door. So, in a non-scientific quest on LinkedIn, I
asked learning practitioners:

- How do you motivate people to give learning to learn time and
  attention when operational pressure is high?

- What practical strategies work to empower people to learn the skill of
  learning?

Thoughtful responses from a range of people provided these insights:

- Support people to be more conscious of what they are learning already
  and help them focus their energy in the right way for them.

- []{#14_CHAP_C14.xhtml_page_252 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 252"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Pay attention to people's strengths so they
  become hungry to improve on the skills that give them energy.

- Stop distinguishing between work and learning -- see your work as a
  learning opportunity.

- Support people to learn skills at work that they can use beyond work
  -- learning in the flow of life.

- Vice versa -- skills from outside can be applied at work.

- Promote and protect learning time as a normal part of your work.

- Make it an objective for everyone to complete a primary piece of
  research once a year -- they'll learn from it.

- Use action learning sets so people actively reflect on work and learn
  from it.

Thanks to Toby Newman, Dimitri Roman, Phil Willcox and Carl Crisostomo
for your contribution to the conversation.

Whatever you choose to do, learning is a lifelong skill and you won't
regret learning to learn effectively.

There is something curious about learning digitally because it appears
that 'digital learning' may have less impact on your brain than other
digital activity, such as video games designed for entertainment rather
than learning. It seems that games have noticeable, measurable and
valuable impacts on some important learning skills.

People who play video games are immersed in rich, changing, interactive,
engaging environments which seem to unintentionally build skills that
are often targets for more formal learning. Laboratory tests show
players enhance their visual acuity, track objects better than most
people and improve their levels of attention and multitasking (Bavelier,
2010). Most interesting of all, the varied environment, skills
development and ability to think and react in new situations are highly
transferable; the test activities in the laboratory are quite different
to those they've been practising in the games but playing the games has
noticeably improved the skills required for learning the new tasks in
the lab. Some researchers suggest that the constant requirement in games
to adapt to new environments and task demands have helped players simply
to learn to learn better -- a skill that is going to be more and more
important with the rate of change most of us experience in work. These
effects persist for the long term and can still be detected 6 to 12
months later (Green et al, 2010).

Conversely, digital learning programmes designed specifically to enhance
learning for specific skills seem to have less short- and long-term
impact on the brains of those who use the tools, whether adults or
children. Games manufacturers may be able to teach us some lessons. One
interesting idea from the study of digital gaming is this: rather than
study the neuroscience and try to build learning based on that, unpick
the digital games that are already found to produce results and then
work out how and why they []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_256 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 256" role="doc-pagebreak"}work. Of course I still
believe understanding the neuroscience of learning is going to be
valuable too.

In this chapter you're going to find answers to some questions (see
[Figure 15.1](#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_Figure_15_1)). What's
different, if anything, between digital and other types of learning?
What's not 'brain friendly' about digital learning and what is? Plus
you'll identify some practical ideas you can use to make digital
learning more brain friendly:

- How digital technology affects our brains.

- Virtual reality learning -- how real is it?

- Social digital learning -- do we want it?

- Practical tips for designing and delivering digital learning.

Since the onset of the Covid pandemic almost everyone has become more
familiar with digital learning technology. Some people loved being
thrown in the deep end and others loathed it but what it's safe to say
is it's accelerated the change to digital learning that was already on
its way.

I'll start by declaring I'm not an expert in digital learning but my
background in IT left me with a deep interest in technology and how it
can serve us to learn and train more effectively. I've been involved in
designing, implementing and using digital learning and I'm usually an
early adopter or supporter of new technology, even when it is sometimes
scary and challenging. I'm particularly proud to be part of the team
building a skills learning platform grounded in neuroscience.

[]{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_257 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 257"
role="doc-pagebreak"}If you're already an expert in digital learning
then I trust you will discover some new ideas to add to your armoury. If
you're newer to digital then I hope you'll see the value and benefits
digital technology can bring to workplace learning.

## [What is digital learning?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_15_CHAP_C15_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h2_003 .head-a}

Wikipedia has this description: 'Digital learning is any type of
learning that is accompanied by technology or by instructional practice
that makes effective use of technology. It encompasses the application
of a wide spectrum of practices including blended and virtual learning.'

In terms of the tools used in digital learning, outside of your brain of
course, there's a really useful list produced each year by Jane Hart of
the Centre for Learning and Performance Technologies. The list has
rapidly grown and then consolidated to the top 100 most useful tools for
learning that people have voted for as ones that they use. Currently
there are 35 different categories, split into four main areas:
Instructional, Content Development, Social Tools, Personal and
Professional Development Tools. I recommend a visit to Jane's website if
you're trying to find a tool or even just trying to distinguish between
different types
([[https://www.toptools4learning.com/]{.url-hyperlink}](https://www.toptools4learning.com/)
(archived at
[[https://perma.cc/FL99-85Q2]{.url-hyperlink}](https://perma.cc/FL99-85Q2%20)).
Each year, more technology appears to add to the list so if you're an
expert in digital and your favourite technology isn't mentioned in this
chapter then I apologize, but this is a book about brains rather than
tools.

We're all experiencing digital learning in many ways inside and outside
of work. Simply 'googling' or 'youtubing' something can be digital
learning, though isn't always. Alternatively, you may be actively
learning a language through Duolingo or enrolled on a MOOC or listening
to podcasts or audio courses. You might be immersed in gamification,
using bots, working with artificial intelligence (AI) or virtual reality
(VR). You may be learning from webinars, virtual classrooms or
conversations on Zoom or Teams. We've all got access to the technology
but are we always learning or are we merely being exposed to information
or ideas without any long-term changes in knowledge, behaviour, skills,
attitude or our brains? Just reading about something, answering some
multiple choice questions or watching a video isn't usually sufficient
work to call it learning any more than reading a book is learning; you
may learn something but exposure isn't a guarantee of learning and very
unlikely to lead to transfer.

[]{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_258 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 258"
role="doc-pagebreak"}At the very end of his 2017 book *Learning
Technologies in the Work Place*, Donald Taylor reminds us of something
very important. He's written 14 really interesting chapters about the
technology, the history, how it's used currently and the future, but his
final sentence is this: 'Success in learning technologies depends on
just one thing: the people'.

Whatever the technology, our brains are still the same damp, pink,
interconnected, complicated tangle of cells and much of what goes on in
it when we learn is the same, regardless of the tools. So, a lot of what
you've already read about effective learning applies just the same in
digital learning. Sometimes we may need to be more creative about how we
use the technology in a digital context but armed with a focus on
results and the learner experience it's clearly possible to make digital
learning as valuable as any other type of learning.

### Benefits of digital learning {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_001 .head-b}

- Accessibility -- everyone can have access.

- Immediate -- it can be in the palm of your hand and in context.

- Just-in-time learning -- perhaps it's not even learning but the
  information is there when needed.

- Less time spent travelling, out of office and possibly more time to
  sleep.

- Collaborative and social -- when done well.

- Global -- everyone can have access to the same learning -- it's even
  easy to translate.

- Personalized -- you can choose what you want -- so long as it's not
  'sheep dip' digital training.

- Faster to redesign.

- Can ensure everyone gets the same information -- though not
  necessarily the same learning.

- Can be cheaper -- especially if designed for large numbers.

- Valuable for previews and for spaced learning -- especially as part of
  a blended approach.

- Monitoring, assessment and data collection is much easier. Just make
  sure you know why you're collecting and measuring.

The technology for digital learning is developing all the time and while
there are still plenty of examples of non-brain friendly learning
through []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_259 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 259"
role="doc-pagebreak"}technology, which is just as true of pencil and
paper, there are huge opportunities to use digital technology really
effectively.

## [Does digital learning affect our brains?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_15_CHAP_C15_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h2_004 .head-a}

Of course we hope that digital learning affects our brains in that all
learning affects our brains but does it actually change the way your
brain works in a way that's different to non-digital learning? Are there
measurable differences due to the use of digital technology that we can
measure and that may have positive or negative impacts on learning? This
is not a comprehensive account of the changes that may happen in your
brain as a result of digital activity but it does cover most of the
important areas for learning.

### Sleep {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_002 .head-b}

If you've already read the chapter on sleep then you know that the blue
light from digital technology, including relatively old technology like
television, interrupts our sleep patterns and therefore prevents
effective consolidation of memory. That's not necessarily a problem
because there are plenty of filters for reducing that blue light, but
that doesn't necessarily solve the sleep problem because technology
disturbs you in other ways by stimulating your brain to be more active.
Most of what we do on computers is designed to be interesting, engaging
and to draw your attention, which is exactly the opposite of what you
need for sleep when your brain needs to start winding down.

### Attention {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_003 .head-b}

This brings us to attention. Digital technology of many sorts is
designed to grab our attention and keep it. However, many of the
attention-grabbing features are short-lived and work by constantly
presenting changes in attention so we become better at paying
'continuous partial attention' but less effective at sustaining focused
attention, which is required for learning skills and processing complex
information.

We have become poorer at reading deeper and more sustained information,
says a five-year study from University College London (Carr, 2008). The
researchers tracked how readers accessed articles through their online
library facility and found that readers are now more inclined to skim
[]{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_260 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 260"
role="doc-pagebreak"}articles, switch rapidly to other articles and
rarely return to the same one. While reading, per se, is not an
inherited skill but a learnt one, it has been the source of learning for
most people for hundreds of years. These researchers and others suggest
that we are not only changing what we read but how and why we read. We
are more likely to read for facts and immediate information and less
likely for thinking deeply, making inferences and connections. That may
certainly have an impact on what and how we learn.

However, a question people often ask is whether our attention span has
been changed by the use of technology. Frequently stories appear in the
media suggesting attention spans are shorter, but currently there
appears to be no significant research to say that use of digital
technology has reduced our attention span. This is partially because
attention spans are more strongly related to individuals and the task in
hand so there is little intrinsic value in measuring 'attention span'
itself or in researching it.

### Distraction {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_004 .head-b}

One major challenge for digital learning, and it's clearly worse for
poorly designed digital learning, is the opportunity for distraction. If
your poorly designed e-learning system is sitting in almost the same
place as hour upon hour of hilarious cat videos, then you are facing a
losing battle, however much you use tracking technology to tell whether
people have completed their online programme.

In a study at Stanford University students who said they used many
different media at the same time were more easily distracted (Ophir et
al, 2009). This was true of information in the environment but they were
also distracted by irrelevant information in their own memories and
found it harder to switch from one task to another.

Reduce distraction to a minimum by reducing load, making things
relevant, emotional, as short as possible (though no shorter) and make
your information easy to digest. You'll read about some of the major
things that lead to distraction in the 'Features of the digital world
that don't help learning' a bit later in this chapter. Thank you to
Julie Dirksen of Usable Learning for the interesting conversation about
distraction that influenced my thinking.

### []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_261 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 261" role="doc-pagebreak"}Memory {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_005 .head-b}

Before the advent of digital technology most of what we learnt we had to
remember because it was hard work to look it up in an encyclopaedia or
go and find the right book with the right information. Nowadays,
however, it sometimes feels as if we don't need to remember anything
because we can just google it and this is having an effect on our
memories.

In a study entitled 'Google Effects on Memory: Cognitive consequences of
having information at our fingertips' (Sparrow et al, 2011) the authors
tested students on their memory for some trivial facts (memory
researchers do this frequently). The students were told the information
would be saved or it wouldn't be saved and then later tested on their
recall. Not surprisingly perhaps, students who thought the information
would be saved were less likely to be able to recall the information.

What the students were good at was knowing where the information had
been saved; even down to being able to remember the specific folder the
data was stored in. It's almost as if they were using the digital
information as a prosthetic memory source in the same way as they may
previously have asked friends, family or experts for information.

Other researchers suggest that the way we store memories may be affected
by multitasking. For instance, in a study at UCLA students had to learn
a fairly simple classification task (Wolpert, 2006). In some trials they
were distracted and were effectively forced to multitask, while in
others they were able to focus on the task undisturbed. The fMRI scans
from the trials showed a difference in how their brains processed and
stored the memories. The focused task results showed more activity in
the hippocampus as would be expected while the distracted task sessions
measured more activity in the striatum, which is normally associated
with learning procedural, non-declarative memories. The obvious
difference in this learning was that when asked about the focused tasks
people were able to explain their learning, while on the distracted
tasks people struggled to explain what had happened or how they'd learnt
because their memories were non-declarative. It seemed the distraction
of multitasking had given them less time to reflect as they learnt, had
made their memories less flexible and they had less insight into what
they'd done. The researchers are not saying never multitask, only noting
that multitasking while learning new material affects how you learn it
and your ability to reflect consciously on the learning later.

[]{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_262 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 262"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The study of changes to our memories based on the
use of digital technology is still in its infancy but studies like this
show that learning with digital technology can affect what and how we
remember.

### Creativity, mind wandering and learning {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_006 .head-b}

Creativity is often about linking unconnected ideas and because of this
you draw from ideas pulled from multiple memory sources. One of the
complications of technology changing our memories is we may have fewer
memories to call on in order to think creatively.

Additionally, with increasing time spent using technology we tend to
have less time simply to contemplate. Time spent not focusing and
allowing our minds to wander is a valuable tool for reflection,
creativity and learning. What used to be called 'day dreaming' seems to
have been renamed as 'mind wandering' and can be a valuable learning
activity. Mind wandering is effectively when we turn off attention on a
focused idea or thought and instead let our default network take
precedence. You'll remember when you read about attention in [Chapter
7](#07_CHAP_C07.xhtml) that your brain is quieter overall when you pay
attention and activity is directed to specific areas. When your default
network is at work, the spread of activity across your brain is wider
than when you're focused. This means you can make connections between
unrelated things more easily, often leading you to have insights or
solve problems that you couldn't while you were concentrating. While the
use of digital technology may mean we don't pay such close attention to
one thing at a time it also means we are continually paying attention to
something and therefore not finding time to reflect, imagine,
contemplate or mind wander. Perhaps for learning facts and figures this
won't matter but those are also the things that we can leave to digital
storage. Learning skills or learning to connect, apply or relate
knowledge to your work may be more difficult without time simply to let
your mind wander.

On the other hand, some researchers argue that there is now more time to
be creative because we've freed ourselves up from day-to-day tasks and
that the availability of diverse information, ideas and concepts is
literally within our hands. Tools and apps that inspire and allow people
to create are multiple and easily accessible to everyone, so perhaps
creative thinking isn't yet on its way out.

### []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_263 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 263" role="doc-pagebreak"}What sort of brain do you already have? {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_007 .head-b}

One of the conclusions that seems to be coming from virtual reality and
immersive digital learning is that this type of learning is particularly
useful for skills acquisition and habit building but currently has less
impact for declarative or content-based learning. Plus, it may depend on
what sort of skills you already have. In a University of Illinois study,
students who already had larger caudate nuclei and putamen than others
were more likely to improve their skills for playing a game called Space
Fortress; whereas the size of their hippocampus was less important
(Erickson et al, 2010).

As with many other types of learning it seems that if you're already
equipped to learn something well you'll probably make better progress
than others. However, the growth and changes in these brain structures
still show that we can all improve, regardless of where we start. I
imagine it a bit like sport; I have short legs so I'm unlikely to be
challenging Elaine Thompson-Herah, the 2016 Olympic gold medal winner
for 100 metres. However, by learning better techniques for running and
practising I can improve my running skills.

## [Digital social learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_15_CHAP_C15_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h2_005 .head-a}

Some people may have the impression that digital learning is a solitary
activity as you work your way through an e-learning programme, read a
book online or play a learning game. However, for many people digital
learning is, and benefits from being, highly social.

There are those who believe we already have the best learning technology
within our grasp which needs to be included as part of the digital
package. 'Conversation is the most effective learning technology ever
invented' -- Jay Cross, an American futurist who popularized the term
'e-learning'. And others were early to understand the power of social
media because of our innate need to be social.

'It's exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up
with because you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology...
The inventors, creators, it's me, it's Mark \[Zuckerberg\]... understood
this consciously. And we did it anyway.' -- Sean Parker, the first
president of Facebook (McCarthy-Jones, 2017).

These are two prescient statements from people with a big impact on
digital learning and social connection. Jay Cross understood that
conversation is hugely important to humans because we're social animals
with an []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_264 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 264"
role="doc-pagebreak"}enormous need for social connection and Sean
Parker, along with other social media entrepreneurs, recognized that our
desire for social connection is both a strength and a weakness: one that
can be exploited by those with the knowledge to do so.

Our brains have evolved to respond to other people. One of the concerns
levelled against digital activity is that it is solitary, with a
stereotype of a young person sitting alone at their computer instead of
going out and socializing. That's changed enormously with myriad
opportunities to connect socially through digital media. Most of the
social media companies recognize that a hit of dopamine keeps people
interacting and engaged and we can do the same in L&D by helping people
connect socially online. I'm not going to list all the possible ways to
do this but instead point you to some of the research on social
connection and digital technology.

The 2019 Towards Maturity report, 'The Transformation Journey',
emphasizes: 'Personal connection is vital for modern workplace learning
with 91 per cent believing collaboration, 70 per cent mentoring and
coaching and 81 per cent management support are either essential or very
useful to learn how to do their job.' The report also concludes: '78 per
cent of workers are excited to use technology to network and learn from
each other'.

### Digital learning designers -- a side track into motivation {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_008 .head-b}

If you ask most people who deliver learning what they like about their
jobs they'll say it's the chance to help someone at work or when they
see the 'aha' moment. These are of course great rewards when you're
working live with people whether it's in a face-to-face or virtual
workshop or coaching.

But what happens to the e-learning designer who doesn't usually get that
immediate feedback from the fruits of their efforts, particularly if
they're an independent designer who may rarely meet users? Social
connection is vital for everyone because loneliness is painful, so what
can you do to get your fair share of the social connection if you're the
designer?:

- Join a network like the e-learning network
  [[www.elearningnetwork.org]{.url-hyperlink}](http://www.elearningnetwork.org)
  (archived at
  [[perma.cc/BBZ6-E4S5]{.url-hyperlink}](https://perma.cc/BBZ6-E4S5)).

- Collaborate and celebrate your successes with colleagues.

- Use social media yourself to connect with clients or colleagues rather
  than just sending email.

- Work with a growth mindset and value all feedback.

- []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_265 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 265"
  role="doc-pagebreak"}Learn to be open to the fact it won't always be
  exactly your vision -- there are always compromises.

- Attend virtual learning sessions, webinars, etc. yourself.

- Many platforms have developers forums to support you -- or for you to
  support others.

- Encourage your clients to celebrate successes with you -- they are
  usually proud of what they've achieved too.

My colleague Sam Burrough of Transform eLearning tells me that, to be
resilient, sometimes just connecting with others facing the same
challenge is a great way to get things off your chest. 'There's lots of
whingeing happens on Slack right now -- just make sure you do it in the
right channels.'

## [Virtual reality learning -- how real is it?](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_15_CHAP_C15_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h2_006 .head-a}

Virtual reality is an experience that can transform people and has been
used successfully in clinical applications to treat and retrain people
with anxiety and stress disorders, eating disorders and pain management.
One of the reasons may be because it gives people a much more lifelike
opportunity to embody learning rather than it simply being a cognitive
activity as it can be with other forms of digital or face-to-face
learning.

One expert in cyber-psychology, Giuseppe Riva, suggests it's because
virtual reality works a bit like our brains and he uses the experience
of 'phantom limbs' to explain (Riva, 2017). Phantom limbs are not well
understood but this research suggests your brain creates a 'virtual
simulation' of your body and uses it to anticipate incoming signals
using your stored memories to predict what might happen. However,
without a limb there to generate real signals your brain uses only the
stored memories and predicts incorrectly, causing pain in something that
doesn't actually exist anymore. VR has been used to improve symptoms of
pain for people with phantom limb syndrome by teaching the brain to
predict differently.

This perceptual illusion called embodiment, or the body ownership
illusion, can be created with a rubber hand. People have their left hand
hidden out of sight. Experimenters then stroke the real hand and a
lifelike rubber hand that the person can see. After a short time
subjects begin to treat the rubber hand as if it's their own. In fMRI
scans you can see that if the rubber hand is 'threatened' with a sharp
needle people show activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, which
detects pain, and the pre-motor cortex, which is for
[]{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_266 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 266"
role="doc-pagebreak"}planning movement. Effectively the visual
information overrides the information from your body as to whether the
hand does or doesn't belong to you. VR works in a similar way to
override what your senses are telling you. It creates a simulated world
for you to explore and it tries to predict what you'll experience as a
consequence of your actions. As a tool for learning it has many
possibilities, but does it transfer well to reality?

In 1993 an experiment to see whether virtual reality training
transferred well showed there was no difference in the transfer of
learning from VR to real-world application compared to a group that had
no training at all. Training in the real world showed significant
transfer of learning. However, as you'll appreciate, VR has come on in
leaps and bounds since 1993 (Kozak et al, 2007).

In 2005 another study tested VR, real-life training, and no training on
building a Lego model of a forklift truck (Hamblin, 2005). This one
showed that VR training did improve the complex model-building skills
but not as much as real-world training. The researchers also concluded
that VR learning required participants to have a higher level of general
intelligence, more aptitude with computers and high spatial abilities to
be effective. Perhaps VR may work for some, but not for others seems to
be the implication. But even since 2005 the technology has developed
enormously and become much quicker and cheaper to develop.

A 2007 study showed that the skills acquired in VR training were
transferrable to other VR training situations but not necessarily to the
real world. These researchers concluded that VR itself needed to improve
to make the transfer more effective (Kozak et al, 2007).

By 2017, however, things started to shift, particularly for training
complex motor skills. Baseball players who'd been trained in a virtual
environment performed later in the season better than others who had
participated in normal training (Gray, 2017). One of the suggestions
from the research was that the VR design included simulations that
provided adaptive training, which is difficult to create consistently in
a live training environment, such as balls that defy the laws of
gravity. The VR was designed to offer a 'high degree of variability to
practice conditions and systematically adjusting the level of challenge
based on the athlete's performance'. These are conditions that are known
to be valuable for skills practice and potentially gave the players more
varied opportunities to learn. And perhaps, similarly to the games
players who are immersed in their game environment, it actually improves
their ability to learn by providing a rapidly changing set of
circumstances to which they need to adapt.

[]{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_267 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 267"
role="doc-pagebreak"}VR is beginning to stack up well in the field of
physical skills training, but how is it doing with people skills?
Empathy is certainly a skill that many people need at work and a study
from October 2018 (*NeuroscienceNews*, 2018) shows that VR may offer a
solution here too. Participants in two studies were given empathy
training relating to homelessness, either VR training or face-to-face,
or merely given information about it. The groups who had the training,
whether it was in VR or face-to-face, both reported feeling more
empathetic. However, the group who experienced homelessness through VR
were more likely to sign a petition about homelessness than those who'd
experienced a more traditional training approach. Studies with other
social skills have also shown that VR can be a successful learning tool,
such as a study from 2016 that helped young people with autism to
improve their confidence in social situations. Tandra Allen, head of
virtual training programmes at the Center for BrainHealth said, 'We saw
a lot of growth in their ability to initiate and maintain a
conversation, interpret emotions and judge the quality of a friendship'
(*NeuroscienceNews*, 2016).

One of the biggest challenges for VR is still the cost of design despite
the fact that cost of access keeps coming down. It's still usually a
more expensive option to set up. However, at GSK for instance they've
saved vast amounts of downtime spent training on expensive equipment in
sterile facilities by re-creating the environment on VR. The savings
easily outweighed the cost of the VR design. Plus, people who would
never normally get the opportunity to try out the machinery are able to
experience it. It's even been used for speedier onboarding.

## [Features of the digital world that don't help learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_15_CHAP_C15_h2_007){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h2_007 .head-a}

### Fear of technology {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_009 .head-b}

Fear of technology can put off some people from learning. However, with
more and more exposure to technology in our everyday lives this will
become less of a challenge. Already it appears that concerns about
differences between the uptake of digital learning between younger
learners and older ones are not coming to fruition. However, if people
are being asked to use new, or rapidly changing, technology it makes
sense to give them support to familiarize themselves with the technology
before trying to use it for learning. A good example of this is to hold
a short optional digital session []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_268
.pagebreak aria-label="Page 268" role="doc-pagebreak"}on how to use
technology before starting on a major digital learning programme. Andy
Lancaster and I both recommend this in our easy-to-read *Webinars
Pocketbook* (2015)*.*

### Information overload {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_010 .head-b}

Overload of cognitive information is just as unhelpful in a digital
world as it is in face-to-face learning. Many studies show that using
both text and audio narration at the same time overloads the auditory
channel and it's better to use audio and graphics without any text. In
one study in 1999 a group with audio scored 64 per cent better on their
task than a group with text and audio (Mayer and Clark, 2013).

### Excessive choice {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_011 .head-b}

Too much choice creates overwhelm and can be confusing to learners --
just because something can be included doesn't mean it needs to be and
how choices are presented is vital. This is as true of digital learning
as any other. Simon Howson-Baggott at LinkedIn told me, 'We saw four
times more engagement on LinkedIn Learning vs Lynda.com because the
layout was more accessible. The number of courses remained the same but
they were easier to view and access.' Excellent curation is the key to
helping people find a minimal number of relevant options and it's a
whole skill in itself.

### Lack of flexibility {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_012 .head-b}

Conversely, lack of flexibility leaves people frustrated because they
are forced to follow a path where they may not be the relevant end-user
or perhaps they are already familiar with the content. This doesn't mean
they can't actively recall the content (useful) or know how to use it
but being regularly presented with familiar material is no way to
motivate and engage your audience.

### Exposure vs learning {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_013 .head-b}

Exposure to information isn't learning. There is still plenty of
compliance training that is poorly delivered as large amounts of complex
information that people click through to confirm they've read it. These
are little more than box-ticking exercises to prove someone has been
exposed to the material []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_269 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 269" role="doc-pagebreak"}but it isn't learning. It's
easy and cheap to do of course but don't expect your colleagues to be
better at keeping safe online or preventing money laundering simply
through exposure.

### Lack of emotional connection {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_014 .head-b}

While we're on the subject of technical or compliance training, we need
to consider the **lack** of emotional connection that is often the case
in digital learning, and particularly for technical training. You know
that emotions make learning sticky and yet for some reason technical
training often fails to deliver a strong emotional 'why' to the learner.
Without a reason to connect with the content people are merely going
through the process. Compliance or regulatory training is the stuff that
should keep us safe, protect us from danger, prevent corruption,
infection, accidents, cyber-crime and yet is often a prime candidate for
boring e-learning. I've even seen vendors of compliance training who
plainly state that the subject is boring but they can make the learning
'dazzle' with some gamification. This is the wrong way to go about it. A
more credible approach is to make digital content vital, relevant and
emotionally engaging rather than pop some bells and whistles on the top.

### Reading difficulty {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_015 .head-b}

Some digital design makes reading more difficult. Literacy in a digital
world is becoming a more complex skill than previously required as you
need to interpret infographics, digital 3D images, hyperlinked text as
well as simple text, while at the same time ignoring the distractions of
unrequested pop-ups. Reading is still a vital skill for digital learning
because most digital content is still delivered as text; it's not all
videos and VR. In a more complex world it's necessary to make it easier
and not more difficult to read text. When you put reading barriers in
the way people are more likely to be distracted and less likely to focus
on the learning. In the 'References and further reading' at the end of
this chapter are two suggestions for writing guidelines from the British
Dyslexia Association and European Blind Union with plentiful ideas to
make reading easier for a wider range of people. These may occasionally
conflict with your organizational design guidelines but designers are
usually aiming for visual appeal, not necessarily readability. I'm
making a personal plea here to all digital designers: *Please don't use
pale text on pale backgrounds because it's just annoying even if it's
the most []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_270 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 270"
role="doc-pagebreak"}modern and up-to-date look*. It's not good for our
eyes and strains our brains.

Try this little experiment. Write the words 'dog' and 'cat' in upper and
lower case. Now draw a line around the words and look at the shapes.
You'll see that the UPPER CASE WORDS have the same shape whereas the
lower case words each have their own shape. When you read you're not
only looking at the letters but your brain is also processing the shape
of words to help you interpret. In upper case all words have the same
shape, which can slow down the reading process. In a world where we want
people to learn more and faster there's no point adding additional
cognitive effort for them; write in lower case.

When you are designing for a digital audience (or even for a non-digital
one) then I recommend Susi Miller's book *Designing Accessible Learning
Content* (2021), which includes a practical framework to make all
content inclusive and accessible. It's the right thing to do.

## [More features of the digital world that help learning](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_15_CHAP_C15_h2_008){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h2_008 .head-a}

### Predictability {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_016 .head-b}

The predictability of digital learning can increase use because of its
familiarity. Making the mobile version and the PC-based version of
e-learning look the same reduces the threat response people can feel
with technology. They can concentrate on the material rather than the
medium.

### Effective spaced learning {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_017 .head-b}

Digital learning is the perfect tool for creating effective spaced
learning because it can be scheduled, accessed readily and you can be
nudged at precisely the right time to promote retention. Duolingo was
used as an example to test out 'half-life regression' (HLR) of words in
digital language learning to predict how often users needed to be
prompted with the same word to improve their retention and engagement.
HLR was able to improve Duolingo daily student engagement by 12 per cent
and reduce errors by 45 per cent (Settles and Meeder, 2016).

Currently few digital learning tools provide spaced repetition as a
feature. If you need people to remember the content you've spent so long
designing then this is something to demand.

### []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_271 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 271" role="doc-pagebreak"}Effective use of AI {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_018 .head-b}

The interest in and availability of AI is growing incrementally. It had
been a specialist area but is now becoming accessible to everyone. At
the end of 2022 a tool called ChatGPT from OpenAI took the world by
storm as people began to ask it questions and get back very convincing
answers. And we're all using AI whether we're aware of it or not in
almost every piece of complex digital technology we use.

Effective use of AI, including Bots, will continue to free up L&D from
many previously laborious tasks of data analysis, bookings, sending
information, answering queries, etc.

It will also start to take over some of the jobs that we felt were our
own special 'people' skills. That doesn't mean we'll be out of a job but
it does mean we need to be aware of it and get comfortable with where it
adds value. If you're either curious or maybe feeling a bit nervous
about AI you can't go far wrong with Donald Clark's book *Artificial
Intelligence for Learning* (2020). He critically analyses how AI is an
aid for L&D rather than a replacement.

AI is increasingly used in coaching. Emma Weber from Lever Learning in
Australia has a successful coaching bot called Coach M, which supports
people to transfer their learning into the workplace. Emma says people
sometimes prefer it to real coaches because it's entirely personal to
you and not distracted by its own needs.

At Stellar Labs we're currently implementing four AI algorithms into our
digital technology to support analysis, motivation, transfer and
creation of blended learning.

Of course, AI is only as smart as the people who work with it so you'll
also see ridiculous claims for AI such as 'Employees can gain
information based on their personal learning styles and preferences'.
Just because it's AI doesn't make it smart. As I do the final proofs for
this book it\'s just a week or so since ChatGPT4 was launched. By the
time the book is published it\'s very likely you or your colleagues will
be using ChatGPT4. It\'s going to be a disruptor to how L&D and
education work. I can\'t predict what it will bring -- but I can safely
say the way learning happens in our brains will remain pretty much the
same.

### Availability and accessibility {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_019 .head-b}

Availability is a key feature of digital learning because almost
everyone has a device in their pocket or handbag. You can access
learning where, when and how you want as long as it's accessible too.

### []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_272 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 272" role="doc-pagebreak"}Create knowledge producers {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h3_020 .head-b}

To make digital learning relevant, learners need to become knowledge
producers as well as consumers. It's easy now to ask people to summarize
their skills or their learning in digital media that they can share with
colleagues with similar requirements. But do remember this is still just
knowledge and not learning.

## [Top trumps for designing and delivering in a digital world](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_15_CHAP_C15_h2_009){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml__15_CHAP_C15_h2_009 .head-a}

Digital technology can guide, support, deliver information and support
learning. What actually happens inside people's brains and bodies is the
actual learning and that hasn't changed enormously, however much the
technology advances. Most of the ideas you've already come across in the
rest of the book can be applied to digital learning with a little
creative thinking and imagination.

Lorna Matty of Toyota and Liz Brant from Pineapple Consulting worked
together to deliver powerful learning sessions through webinar
technology. They have a strong belief that not only is this type of
social digital learning saving money and delivering a return on
investment but that there are distinct advantages for the learners too.
Lorna says:

> For me, virtual classrooms give employees a voice they don't always
> feel they can express in a face-to-face environment and as a result
> they say more than they might do. If training is about being learner
> centred, then using virtual classrooms as a blend with other formats
> helps us to do just that.

And Liz's view is:

> Whatever we can do in a physical classroom we can do the same and
> better in a virtual classroom. Physical classrooms can seem very quiet
> and slow in comparison because in the virtual classroom people are
> continually interacting with each other. Virtual classrooms work best
> as part of a blend, but that is true of any learning event.

With a view to designing fantastic digital learning experiences based on
understanding more about how people learn, here's a useful way of
checking whether your digital designs are brain-friendly or could be
more so. Sharon Bowman, president of Bowperson Publishing & Training is
a prolific writer []{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_273 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 273" role="doc-pagebreak"}and learning practitioner. In
her book *Using Brain Science to Make Training Stick* (2011) Sharon has
written about The Six Trumps™ for designing learning based on brain
science.

These top trumps are just as relevant for digital learning as they are
for any other sort of learning, so here are Sharon's original six, and
then I've taken the liberty to add a few more with reference to digital
design and delivery:

1.  Movement trumps sitting.

2.  Talking trumps listening.

3.  Images trump words.

4.  Writing trumps reading.

5.  Shorter trumps longer.

6.  Different trumps same.

Additionally for digital here are another six:

Learning technology has been around since humans first drew pictures on
cave walls and over the years many technologies have been criticized or
accused of changing how we think and learn. Socrates worried about the
impact of writing on how people learnt and in one of his plays a
character suggested that people would 'cease to exercise their memory
and become forgetful'.

When the printing press was developed there were concerns that people
would become intellectually lazy and that the power and value of the
intellectuals and religious authority would be undermined.

Nobody would argue nowadays that reading, writing and books had damaged
long-term learning but they did change how and what people
[]{#15_CHAP_C15.xhtml_page_274 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 274"
role="doc-pagebreak"}learnt. There was no study of psychology or
neuroscience in those days to tell us exactly what had changed but with
our brains being as plastic then as they are now there is no doubt there
were changes. And it will be the same with learning and digital
technology, and whatever comes after to displace it.

Learning is learning and always takes place in the context we find
ourselves; so digital technology is just the latest tool that we're
using because it's freely available, developing fast, and when it's good
it's brilliant.

How mindful are you? Mindfulness is still a hot topic and, in an
excellent blog about the research in the *BPS Research Digest 2015*,
Christian Jarrett says that 40 papers are published per month and 37
books had been written in one particular week alone (Jarrett, 2015). He
rounds up numerous pieces of research putting the case both ways.
Clearly many people value mindfulness. However, there is a lot of hype
about the benefits and it may be that some potentially negative effects
are being ignored or sidelined.

Studies have reported changes in attention and memory processes as well
as emotional functions.

Subjects who were taught to meditate over a course of two months were
seen to have permanent changes in the activity in their amygdala; i.e.
the effects could be seen even when they were not being mindful but were
doing normal everyday activities (Desborde et al, 2012).

One study showed that people engaging in mindful meditation, compared to
subjects who merely mind wandered (the latest way to describe day
dreaming), were more likely to generate false memories, which may have
consequences for learning (Rosenstreich, 2016). However, a follow-up
study was unable to replicate the results (Baranski and Was, 2017).

One mindfulness technique is to physically discard thoughts by, for
example, writing a note and throwing it away. A study testing this found
that subjects who put aside thoughts in this way were less likely to use
the information later in decision-making. Whether they were negative or
positive thoughts that were discarded, they may have value in critical
decisions and planning so effectively ignoring them could have a
negative impact.

Additionally, retreating into mindfulness while enabling people to avoid
negative emotions may also prevent them from critically approaching a
[]{#16_CHAP_C16.xhtml_page_278 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 278"
role="doc-pagebreak"}challenge, preferring to escape a problem rather
than thinking hard and solving it.

In terms of the science it's all rather interesting. Side effects are
recognized as a by-product of any effective treatment. It's a scientific
tenet that 'every action has a reaction'. So, if mindfulness really has
benefits for emotional and attentional control and memory, among other
things, it is equally likely to impact on your mental process in some
ways which may not always be entirely helpful. Overactive attention and
memory systems can cause problems and we evolved emotional responses to
help us learn and keep us safe. Now we know that real physical changes
happen in our brains when we think and learn we need to be aware of the
effects of any activity with the power to change the way our brains
work.

You're nearing the end of this book so you're probably aware that there
is a phenomenal amount of research on and interest in neuroscience at
the moment and that the discoveries we're making about how our brains
work in numerous areas are multiplying all the time. There are so many
new things that it's impossible to give a comprehensive account of the
hottest topics and this week's hot topic may well be superseded by next
week's. So what you'll read here, visually described in the mind map in
[Figure 16.1](#16_CHAP_C16.xhtml__16_CHAP_C16_Figure_16_1), is the
briefest snapshot of three areas that may be relevant for people, like
you, with an interest in the neuroscience of learning: the quantum
brain, some aspects of technology and cognitive enhancement drugs. Other
aspects of digital learning are now covered in their own chapter.

When Professor Peter Higgs was asked to encapsulate the Higgs Boson in
an interview he quite rightly explained that he'd spent most of his life
studying quantum particles and there was no way he could explain it in a
30-minute interview. I think we can safely accept that neither you nor I
are going to understand the quantum brain by the end of this book and
that at a practical level it's probably not yet going to make much
difference to the way you learn or help others learn.

You might not normally think of brain function in terms of physics but
of course in a physical world everything does come down to physics in
the end. Classical physics supposes that events are not random but
caused by other events, whereas quantum physics is based on the
probability that an event may or may not happen. This may allow us to
start thinking about will, attention and consciousness in a different
way because quantum theory could start to explain some of the puzzling
differences between your brain and your 'mind'. Amy Brann in her book
*Neuroscience for Coaches* (2015) does an excellent job of explaining
the quantum brain for the lay person and says 'we will continue to see
more of the science that demonstrates the power of our mind to affect
our brain'.

You can measure physical changes in your brain with fMRI scanners and
EEG machines, but that doesn't yet help to fully explain your thoughts
and how those impact on your physical brain. We can, to a degree,
describe psychological concepts such as consciousness, attention,
intention and have an intuition that our thoughts have an impact on our
physical brains and on our behaviour but there isn't a classical physics
explanation for what that really means. Once we get into quantum physics
and start talking about the possibilities of particles being in one
place or another at the same time it may become easier to start having a
better scientific theory to explain our 'mind' rather than just our
brain.

Elements of quantum theory are being used to explain some of the
elements of fundamental brain function such as exactly how
neurotransmitters really pass information across the synaptic gap.
Neurotransmission relies on calcium ions being passed across the
synaptic gap via minuscule ion channels but there is quantum uncertainty
as to whether a particular ion will be absorbed or not. This leads to
the possibility, at a simplified level, of you having one thought rather
than another; it perhaps starts to provide an explanation of how you can
choose your thoughts rather than them being determined.

This third edition includes a chapter devoted to digital learning, where
you can find out more about how learning through technology may be
shaping our brains. Here is another example of how the combination of
neuroscience and technology can work together.

*Computational neuroscience* aims to explain human thinking through
computer models and has passed through many phases of development such
as artificial intelligence, Expert Systems thinking and now there are
some fascinating developments in *cybernetics and robotics*. Kevin
Warwick, a researcher in cybernetics at Reading University, is working
on neural networks that control mini robots. He effectively takes rat
neurons and connects them up to these robots and then analyses how the
neural networks grow so that the robots 'learn' to run without bumping
into the walls. This becomes a combination of the computational science
that uses computers to model human learning and the neuroscience of
living organisms.

Brain implants have successfully treated patients with deafness,
epilepsy and Parkinson's disease among others but now there are
experiments where a cognitive skill is being targeted.

In March 2018 one group of scientists effectively created a memory
prosthesis by sending electrical information through two implanted wires
into the brains of a small group of patients (Powell, 2018). Initially
subjects had to do simple word recall memory tests and the areas of the
brain associated with poor recall were noted. Later scientists found
that disrupting those areas with an electrical pulse during the testing
enabled other more successful memory areas to function and improved
recall performance by up to 15 per cent.

In another study researchers recorded signals from the hippocampus as
subjects got answers correct on short-term memory tests. They later
delivered the same signals back into the brain and the test scores rose
on average by 35 per cent. (This was also reported in *NBC News* by
Powell, 2018).

The research is being funded initially to support military personnel
with brain damage but researchers believe it will be available to
patients with other memory problems such as Alzheimer's too. This type
of research opens the doors to ideas such as enhancing your learning
skills by adding cybernetic prostheses to your brain -- and it's now
nearer scientific fact than the wilder realms of science fiction.

Can taking drugs make you a better learner? Many drugs affect your brain
and have effects on your learning mechanisms but can you take drugs to
specifically make you learn more effectively? Numerous magazine articles
and scientific papers report significant numbers of healthy students
taking drugs like Ritalin, usually prescribed for people with Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or Modafinil, a prescription-only
medication for narcolepsy, to help them get through exam time. A 2016
survey (Kodsi) suggested 15 per cent of students at Oxford University
resorted to drugs and this mirrored similar surveys in other UK
universities. It seems that many of their lecturers and professors are
also using similar drugs to help them think more effectively or
concentrate better when they've got a paper to publish. With so many
more psychoactive drugs being discovered and on the market to help with
anything from ADHD to Alzheimer's it's inevitable that people will find
they can take them to boost their normal brainpower. Some of these
'drugs' may be natural supplements and not controlled in the same way as
prescription drugs. In a 2018 study (Weyandt et al), researchers
reported that, contrary to popular belief and their expectations, ADHD
drugs didn't improve cognition in healthy college students and seemed to
impair working memory.

There is a debate to be had over the moral and ethical consequences of
taking these drugs in a similar way to which the sports world has had to
address performance boosting drugs. A study from 2017 (*Science Daily*,
2017) reported that people performed better in a chess game with a
computer after taking a drug called Modafinil. However, when you read
the study it seems that though players thought more deeply and their
cognitive skills appeared to be enhanced, they actually lost more games
because games were timed to only 15 minutes and the deeper thinking
meant that they took longer to make decisions. So sometimes being
smarter isn't the way to achieve what you need. Long-term use of this
drug and others like Ritalin ultimately can reduce plasticity and damage
memory in young brains. Scientists are certainly calling on governments
and the rest of us to look at the reality of the situation and to think
about what we want to do. Suffice it to say, regardless of what we as a
society decide, people may have always taken drugs to help them think
differently; it may even be something we have in common with our
evolutionary ancestors. In 2015 there was a news report about chimps
drinking naturally fermented palm wine (Hockings et al). Researchers
don't know whether it's the rich source of sugar they like or
[]{#16_CHAP_C16.xhtml_page_282 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 282"
role="doc-pagebreak"}whether they enjoy the feeling of inebriation;
whatever the reason, their brains are clearly affected and changed by
the palm wine.

At the moment it's unlikely that we'll be seeing the big pharmaceutical
companies with stands at Learning and Development conferences selling
pills to help you learn, but it is worth being aware that the
generations coming into and already working in your organization may be
far more familiar with these drugs.

There are numerous new ideas from neuroscience that may have an impact
on the practical aspects of learning, wherever it takes place. Here are
four key ideas:

- The quantum brain -- the application of quantum theory to neuroscience
  which is still in its infancy and probably has little immediate impact
  for your practice of Learning and Development.

- Mindfulness is still a popular idea among many as a way to improve
  focus and attention but it may also have some negative effects on
  memory and decision-making.

- Cybernetics and brain prostheses are already being used in specific
  clinical areas of learning but may one day be available more widely.

- Cognitive enhancement drugs are a growing field which hasn't made much
  of an impact on the world of L&D at the moment but we need to be aware
  of them.

At an 'unconference' in London in 2014 some of us were looking for a
metaphor to explain our purpose in Learning and Development: something
to represent us as being experts in the facilitation of learning rather
than experts in knowledge itself. In case you've never attended an
unconference it's a get-together of like-minded people but with the
agenda decided by the participants rather than the organizers -- a far
more participative and engaging approach to conferences.

Was it something about having travelled into London on the Tube? Was it
an unconscious sighting of a Tube map on the far wall (I only
consciously spotted it later on)? Or was it something somebody said? I
don't know what unconscious processes were operating but the metaphor
that came to me was how L&D professionals in the 21st century are like
the London Tube (or any other railway system really).

There is 'knowledge' kept at the stations that needs to be carried to
other places and we can be conduits for that knowledge. The knowledge
may be online, in the heads of experts, in documents (alight at Euston
Square for the British Library) or in multiple other places. It could be
factual, semantic knowledge or it could be intangible knowledge about
how to perform a task or demonstrate a skill.

A colleague at the conference, Robert Weeks (@chutzpah84 if you're a
Twitter user) tweeted my analogy: 'I think \@stellacollins has just made
me manager of a tube network... L&D connects networks and knowledge in
organizations'. Robert suggested 'L&D need to connect up the stations
and create more interchanges' and together we built the metaphor a bit
more.

[]{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_285 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 285"
role="doc-pagebreak"}We can remove blockages, open train doors, help
people move through the system with maps and timetables, suggest optimal
routes, check their tickets for particular journeys, provide a kind
word, help less able travellers, change routes if necessary, recognize
times of stress on the system and passengers and adjust accordingly.
Occasionally L&D need to build new stations or to redefine which station
houses which type of 'knowledge'. Occasionally we might refurbish a
station and change the décor but it will still be near the same
landmarks.

One of the things I like about this metaphor is we all expect to travel
on the Tube or any other railway network when we want and where we want
and we don't expect someone to take us there. Passengers are generally
self-reliant -- they find information on the phone, on the internet, on
boards at stations, face-to-face, asking friends who travel regularly --
isn't this how learners can become responsible for their own learning
journeys? L&D can be seen as a system that helps people do their job and
they may use us every day or they may only occasionally need us but
either way our role is to take people from one place to another while
they continue to do their key role. No analogy or metaphor is perfect
but it feels like this one works as a starter. Perhaps you'll disagree,
perhaps you'll find the place it breaks down or perhaps you'll build on
it too. It doesn't really matter so long as we all keep thinking about
our role in learning.

## [What you'll find in this final chapter](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_17_CHAP_C17_h2_002){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h2_002 .head-a}

You'll review the role of neuroscience and psychology in Learning and
Development and reflect briefly on the key ideas from each chapter (see
[Figure 17.1](#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_Figure_17_1) for the
chapter overview). You'll think about what it all means for you in your
role of helping others to learn and you may hear a few thoughts about
what makes me cross or excited. This chapter is really about the 'so
what?' It's where you can start to put your learning into action. What
can you do with the neuroscience of Learning and Development?

## [A race through a review](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_17_CHAP_C17_h2_003){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h2_003 .head-a}

You galloped through some of the technical bits of brain structures and
how science works. You explored the idea that neuroscience is a complex
mix of disciplines: biological, psychological and even computational and
have come across elements of most of them in this book. You read what
happens []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_286 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 286"
role="doc-pagebreak"}to your brain when you're learning and you used the
GEAR model to give structure to the process of learning. You thought
about how to motivate learners, how information gets into their heads
and how they pay attention. You considered different ways to explore
information and to help people make sense of different types of learning
before moving on to thinking about memory and what makes learning
sticky. For effective learning, you need to test, experiment, practise
and reflect, and you also thought about how to build habits. Reviewing
turns out to be a key factor in learning and you considered different
ways and times to review and apply learning. You raced through some
ideas about creativity, language, stories, music and the environment;
you explored sleeping and digital learning before charging headlong into
the future with thoughts about technology, quantum brains and smart
drugs. You've also considered aspects of learning to learn from a
personal and L&D perspective.

And now it's time to think about what this all means for you: what you
will do differently, some challenges we all face in L&D and some of the
benefits to thinking about neuroscience.

## [Some challenges of embracing neuroscience into your practice](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_17_CHAP_C17_h2_004){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h2_004 .head-a}

### The bandwagon of neuroscience {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_001 .head-b}

Over the past few years there's been an increase in popular interest
about how our brains work. There are more programmes on the TV and a
fountain of books, articles, websites and blogs. People attend training
to find out about the neuroscience of virtually everything from
neuroeconomics to neuropolitics and you can buy neurotoys, neurodrinks
and neuromusic. []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_287 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 287" role="doc-pagebreak"}This is really exciting as
long as it's not just a bandwagon fuelled by brain myths and a desire to
have the latest fashion. The neuroscience of learning is hugely
fascinating and what we don't know still eclipses what we do know, so
there's plenty more to discover and learn. At least now you've got some
useful questions (from [Chapter 3](#03_CHAP_C03.xhtml)) to ask when you
hear 'research says...' or 'neuroscience shows...'.

Some of what neuroscience does is to provide data to 'prove' what is
already obvious to the rest of the world. If an fMRI scanner can 'show'
that mothers really do feel emotion when they look at babies it doesn't
make that emotion any more or less real. Knowing that your working
memory is located in your dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be
interesting but a) I can't ask you to 'fire up your dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex' and b) it won't improve your ability to read this
sentence.

But this data can help you in multiple ways. You may use it to influence
other people who don't have the experience or background in practical
training and learning that you have, and who are currently confusing
learning with 'content'. You can help them understand why you don't have
a magic wand and that learning isn't a passive sponge-like absorption of
information or skills. This is our opportunity to educate other people
about L&D, and neuroscience and psychology give us some valuable
ammunition to work with.

I started this book suggesting that you don't need to be a
neuroscientist to be a great trainer, educator, coach, or learning
facilitator. However, as you've seen, if you're a good trainer or
designer and people are learning, you are fundamentally changing
people's brains, so it is worth understanding enough about the hardware
and software that you're working with to get the best results.

### Real-world application {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_002 .head-b}

One of the biggest challenges to using the ideas from neuroscience is
the application in your world. As you've read earlier, much of the
research comes from laboratories full of WEIRD people, case studies of
people who've suffered some kind of neural damage, or from developmental
psychology and the education system. And the research is sometimes
contradictory because the experiments are so specific that it can be
hard to work out how they relate to learning at work. There's far less
rigorous research done on learning in the workplace or with adult
learners generally, so perhaps it's time to start changing that. Perhaps
the next time you're asked []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_288 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 288" role="doc-pagebreak"}to deliver a major training
programme you can use it as an opportunity to do some research and
measure, test and share the results of different practices. I know this
throws up difficulties with operational issues and there may be
complications in asking people to participate in research. After all,
you don't want to spend two days learning customer service skills in a
control group only to find it's not as effective as the new technique
another group had. However, if, as learning professionals, we don't
consider the possibilities of experimenting then we'll definitely never
get there. With universities looking to collaborate more with business
now there are more opportunities to do and share research from
operational environments.

### Vested interests {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_003 .head-b}

Whether you're an individual or an organization, vested interests play a
part when you're asked to change your practice. As an example,
psychometric testing is an enormous industry. In a Freedom of
Information document, the MOD alone revealed they spent over £245,000 on
psychometric testing in 2013/14. A report from Emergen Research suggests
the global assessment services market size in 2021 was USD 12.32
billion. Many of these psychometric tests have been in use for many
years but are largely discredited by the evidence-based community.
Myers--Briggs, one of the most famous psychometric instruments was
invented by a mother-and-daughter team who developed their ideas from
the non-researched work of Carl Jung and published their first
Myers--Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) tool back in 1943. People argue the
tool has been validated in the sense that many, many people have used
it, but in the 1950s many people were also recommended smoking as a cure
for stress. There is absolutely no scientific evidence to back it up.

It may even be that personality testing itself is a flawed concept. In
*Multiplicity: The new science of personality* (2008), Rita Carter
questions the concept of having a unified personality and suggests we
may all have multiple personalities, some of which we may be unaware of.
Other research suggests that your environment has as much or more of an
effect on you than your personality. In a famous 'Good Samaritan' study
(Darley and Batson, 1973) it was found that even seminary students were
more affected by how hurried they felt than by their own, presumably
'good' personality traits. When they were put into a rushed situation
many of them were prepared to step over a slumped figure on the ground
in order to get to a meeting to deliver a presentation about the Good
Samaritan. More and []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_289 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 289" role="doc-pagebreak"}more evidence suggests we are
unconsciously influenced by environmental factors that override our
'personality' making us behave appropriately for the situation. Yet
personality tests are big business.

My point is there are vested interests in keeping us using the same
tools and techniques that have been around a long time even if new
research seems to question them; not only economic vested interests but
you may also awaken some cognitive dissonance if you have to change your
own or someone else's ideas about how 'training' happens. After all, if
your organization has invested large amounts of money in a leadership
development programme complete with complicated models and attractive
resources it's not going to take kindly to the idea that there may be a
different way to do this. Cognitive dissonance is the psychological
struggle we feel when we hold two competing ideas and we tend to want to
distance ourselves from anything that increases the dissonance.

Think about an L&D manager who's spent a lot of time and energy
persuading the board that it would be really useful to do some
psychometric testing to identify people's learning styles and then
finally being successful and designing some training to meet those
styles. Suddenly they find out the research debunks learning styles. Are
they likely to go back to the board and say 'everything I talked about
for the past five years about learning styles may have been thrown into
question and we have wasted some time and money'? This is likely to
cause a significant threat response in all concerned, reducing good
quality thinking and increasing the risk of 'fight or flight' behaviour
to the new idea.

Fortunately, by embracing scientific principles you can navigate a way
round this particular challenge. Instead of telling the rest of your
organization that you're an expert on learning and know everything there
is to know, you can tell them that you're a researcher into learning and
that the sciences of psychology and neuroscience are adding to what you
know. Explain that brain research is a growing discipline and we're
learning more every day but there's more to discover than we currently
know. As such, you will work with the best available evidence at the
time but you reserve the right to change your methods if and when some
better, more reliable evidence comes along. By setting yourself up as an
investigator, a scientist, a learner yourself, you can more easily
embrace new ideas and reduce the threat that experts feel when their
expertise is challenged.

Neuroscience and psychology don't have all the answers and won't be able
to fix everything for you but they do offer the opportunity for everyone
to view L&D in a slightly different light.

### []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_290 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 290" role="doc-pagebreak"}Constraints {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_004 .head-b}

In an ideal world you'd have all the money and resources to invest in
designing and delivering completely wonderful, brain-friendly
environments and technology based on all the best and most up-to-date
science, but we all recognize the world doesn't work like that. There
are constraints imposed for all sorts of reasons. For instance, this
book doesn't embrace all the ideas from neuroscience that you could
apply to sharing information: it's in black and white rather than
colour; there are a limited number of pictures; there are few
activities; and you can't hear it or smell it or taste it. However, it
does break information into chunks, includes multisensory language,
metaphors and stories and uses as much direct, simple language as
possible. Hopefully we both recognize the constraints of a book written
in a particular format for a particular audience. Here are some ideas
that will help you retain the general gist of the book even if you don't
remember the details. For the best results spend 10--15 minutes
reflecting on what you learnt. You could:

- Draw a picture or create a mind map of the key elements.

- Rewrite the summaries in each chapter -- either the mind maps at the
  start or the bullet points at the end.

- Go and tell someone else what you learnt from reading it.

- Ask yourself questions about what you learnt -- if you can't quite
  remember then guess and immediately go back and check your answers.

- Summarize each chapter in a tweet.

In training you will also have constraints imposed because of timing,
funding, operational elements, etc. but what I'm suggesting is you
challenge them when you can and when you know they will impact adversely
on learning. And back up your challenges with research, studies or data.
If the []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_291 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 291"
role="doc-pagebreak"}budget holder thinks it will save money because
it's quicker just to tell people how to be compliant with the new food
hygiene regulations you can counter with the amount of information
they'll actually retain after 24 hours, the cost of being found
non-compliant because they hadn't remembered the key facts, and how you
can significantly increase their retention and compliance with some
effective training. That will need more investment than a one-hour
briefing by the compliance manager, but the results will be better.

Having challenged as much as possible, use the neuroscience to work
around the constraints and make up for what you can't change. If the
training has to be webinar-based then what do you know from the
neuroscience that will help you build rapport and increase participants'
attention from a distance?

<aside class="box" id="_17_CHAP_C17_sec_002" aria-label="Box (17.1)" role="complementary">

After Robert Weeks and I had reminded each other of the metaphor at the
start of this chapter, Robert added some more useful thoughts about how
learners have different experiences of learning that may impact on how
you work with them...

The other observation I'd make is that when you very infrequently use
the Tube network (as I do) even though all the links are there, it can
be very hard to navigate and find your way round.

'I know I want the green one and to head towards X' is what I keep
repeating in my head as I walk amongst the crowds at rush hour trying
not to stop at the map and cause half of the city to pile up behind me.

Compare that to a friend of mine who lived in London and frequently
travelled on the Tube daily for work. She could play a game where she
would tell you how to get from one random station to another in the
shortest amount of time, and was experienced enough to vary her journey
instantly if you said 'aha, but what if Embankment was closed for
maintenance?'

If you use the network often, you can do this. If you don't, even if
someone else has kept it well established, it can take a bit longer to
find your way around... and we all love to travel effortlessly so it can
be a bit off-putting.

## [Benefits of applying practical ideas from neuroscience](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_17_CHAP_C17_h2_005){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h2_005 .head-a}

### Your professionalism {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_005 .head-b}

Like all professions, in Learning and Development we need to
continuously develop our practice and to learn, innovate and build.
Sometimes we have a tendency to react to what the business demands of us
and to want to provide what they ask rather than stopping to analyse
what they need. By taking a step back and analysing what we know about
how people think, how they behave and how they learn we are better
equipped to challenge and contribute to our organizations.

This is what good learning practitioners have always done but by
embracing real scientific principles we can demonstrate that we are a
profession that has rigour and guidelines rather than being seen as
something 'pink and fluffy'.

[]{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_292 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 292"
role="doc-pagebreak"}We can also challenge ourselves to examine those
woolly models, myths and ideas that have been lurking in the back of our
professional cupboards and just see whether they stand up to the cold
light of day. It's quite possible that some of them will dust off well
and continue to be useful, but others could be retired in view of your
current and growing levels of knowledge.

Perhaps it's time we renamed 'soft skills' -- once you realize how much
needs to go on inside your head and body to learn a new skill it becomes
easier to see why so-called 'soft skills' are actually quite difficult.
I'm not suggesting we call them 'hard skills' because that might be
off-putting for learners. While 'brain plasticity' is now a more common
term, 'plastic skills' doesn't quite seem right. As these are the skills
that can make the difference to whether someone is successful or not at
work Josh Bersin (2022), industry analyst and thought leader, for
instance calls them 'power skills'. Perhaps when they are measured more
accurately and trained more precisely the name will matter less.

### It's enjoyable for you, the trainer {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_006 .head-b}

Most people in Learning and Development love learning -- that's often
why they got into the profession. I've seen many people in the last few
years incredibly enthused and excited about having this new area of
neuroscience to study and apply, so, if nothing else, neuroscience gives
you some great new learning opportunities, which may well flood your
brain with curiosity-stimulated dopamine and other pleasure promoting
hormones. It's certainly causing lots of new neuronal connections to

### It's enjoyable and effective for learners {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_007 .head-b}

Applying the ideas from neuroscience, whether you call it Brain Friendly
Learning or something else, makes learning so much easier, more
enjoyable and more satisfying for learners. Watching people make
connections, have light-bulb moments and enjoy the experience of
learning is hugely rewarding. People regularly tell me it's the first
time they've ever enjoyed learning something at work -- sometimes since
they were small children. Enjoying the learning is part of the battle
but more importantly people remember what they learn and apply it
satisfactorily back at work.

### []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_293 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 293" role="doc-pagebreak"}The organization gets a better return on investment {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_008 .head-b}

Investment in learning happens in multiple ways. Traditionally,
organizations have measured people's satisfaction with the learning
experience but with technology and greater data skills we can start to
be much smarter about measuring behaviours and impact of change.
Applying some of the neuroscience of learning to design and deliver
effective training will save time, heartache and money. It may take
longer for someone to genuinely learn a new skill than it takes to throw
information at them wholesale, but the benefits for their performance
are obvious.

## [Top ideas to take away](#00_PRELIMS_s10_Contents.xhtml_toc_17_CHAP_C17_h2_006){.referrer role="doc-backlink"} {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h2_006 .head-a}

### Never do for the learner what they can do for themselves {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_009 .head-b}

When your work is about learning and you're committed and enthused it
can become easy to take responsibility for what learners are learning,
but you can't control what's going on in someone else's head. You
certainly won't help learners learn by doing their learning for them.
So, as often as you possibly can, let the learners do the work of
learning.

If they ask you a question, ask them to guess the answer, see if someone
else in the group can answer it or encourage them to go and find it
somewhere (at least that way they know where to find the information a
second time).

Let learners use equipment and experiment with it rather than picking it
up and showing them again.

At the end of a training session, if you've really switched the
responsibility for learning to the learners they are likely to feel
energized and buzzing, and their heads will feel full, ready for them to
go and get a good night's sleep and let the learning start sticking.

### There's no such thing as a boring topic -- only boring training {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_010 .head-b}

If you as the trainer are tempted to think a topic is boring then it's
your responsibility to re-examine it and redesign it -- there really are
no boring topics in the world. If people are bored you've not found
their motivation or you're presenting information poorly. Learners are
not getting the experience of learning which in itself is inherently
gratifying -- all those neurotransmitters floating around and all those
connections wiring. Some trainers []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_294
.pagebreak aria-label="Page 294" role="doc-pagebreak"}think it's easier
to motivate people to learn and to include multisensory resources,
movement, engagement, challenge and discussion when it's soft skills
training, but harder when there is something technical or data or
process driven. This isn't the case, of course -- if it's vitally
important that someone learns a process in a particular order then they
need to be significantly motivated and attention, movement, Links,
Emotion, Anchors, Repetition, Novelty and Stories become even more
important. Learning isn't always easy but it should never be boring.

### You don't have to be a neuroscientist {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_011 .head-b}

If you forget the names of parts of the brain or can't work out one
neurotransmitter from the next it's really not going to matter, unless
possibly you're teaching neuroscience! You are a learning professional
and you work with people in different ways, many of which have proved
themselves to be reliable and effective ways of delivering learning. You
may well have the practical experience that tells you something is
effective even when there isn't currently any neuroscience to back it up
-- that doesn't mean it doesn't work. What neuroscience gives you is the
opportunity to check what you're doing and measure it against what the
research tells you but the ultimate test is whether someone learns
effectively and can use their learning where it matters.

### Share learning with learners -- spread the word {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_012 .head-b}

There's no point in us as professionals having all this wonderful
knowledge about how people's brains and minds work and keeping it to
ourselves. Sharing what works with your learners helps them to be more
effective and to learn better for themselves. Explaining to them that
they need to review what they've learnt, that sleeping on it will help,
and giving them responsibility for learning will do more for your
learners than any number of wonderfully prepared slides, detailed
handouts or fantastic exercises.

### Learning isn't all about 'fun' {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_013 .head-b}

You may hear that learning should be 'fun'. This is a very specific
piece of 'advice' because I've worked with scientists, engineers and
other people in technical roles who can be challenged by the concept of
having 'fun' while learning. Not all of them, of course, but some people
find the idea of 'fun' []{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_295 .pagebreak
aria-label="Page 295" role="doc-pagebreak"}demotivating possibly because
they've had training in the past where they've felt foolish because they
were asked to do things they didn't enjoy but were labelled 'fun'. Use
the principles of neuroscience to make learning 'enjoyable' rather than
'fun'. So long as the connections get made and retained it's not our
place to decide what's 'fun', so avoid the label.

### Challenge poor practice! {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_014 .head-b}

I think we have a duty as professionals to challenge what's not working.
You would expect your doctor, accountant or lawyer to challenge poor
practice where they see it and we should be equally confident in our
ability to question what other, less enlightened trainers/designers
might be doing. You may need to find a way to express your disquiet and
to perhaps share with them what would be better practice, but we are
responsible for ensuring that all L&D professionals take learning
seriously. Recently I was at the receiving end of a poor piece of
training and spent time writing some constructive feedback for the
trainer before going up to discuss it face-to-face. My belief had been
that he would receive this feedback in the spirit it was offered, of
mutual support and development from a fellow trainer, so I was somewhat
surprised when he took the 'evaluation form', barely glanced at it and
said, 'Oh, that's not for me -- it's for the organization.' Fortunately,
this sort of response is rare but if we're to challenge poor practice we
also have to be open to feedback ourselves.

### Create learning environments rather than courses/content {#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml__17_CHAP_C17_h3_015 .head-b}

How can you create an environment where learning happens naturally
rather than spending all your time creating content? The content most of
us use at work has mostly already been produced; sometimes perfectly and
sometimes imperfectly but it's probably available somewhere. It will
continue to be produced but it's more likely to be produced by experts
in digital design, hopefully in partnership with learning experts like
you.

As learning professionals, we need to become better at curating the
content that's available. We may do that through our own experience, or
increasingly likely using artificial intelligence and big data to do it.
The right information at the right time needs to be easier for people to
find and access, but we're not in charge of what people learn because
we're not them, in their roles, doing their jobs.

[]{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_296 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 296"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Creating learning environments or journeys in which
people find it easy to think, learn, experiment, challenge, fail,
reflect and apply learning becomes an important role. With self-directed
learning becoming ever more common we also have a role in supporting
people to learn effectively; busting erroneous myths and providing
scaffolding, genuinely helpful models and practical tips for learning.
We need to teach people how they learn and what the best methods are for
them and then let them get on with their learning in context. I also
believe we should teach well-educated learners to vote with their feet
if something isn't helping them get the learning results they need; to
demand more of us rather than passively accept poor e-learning design or
boring delivery.

Digital technology is playing a bigger part for all of us and we must
embrace it and work with it without losing sight of our learners and
their plastic brains. In an article about digital learning trends for
2019, among all the talk of bots, AI, microlearning and virtual reality,
Kirstie Greeney of Elucidat (Greeney, 2018) pointed out that there was a
'strong call for a return to a people focus in learning'.

Whether you've read this book from cover to cover, dipped in and out or
skipped straight to this last chapter, you will have changed something
in your brain. What would be really valuable is that you change
something in the outside world too so that you can demonstrate what
you've learnt.

Only you know where you were on your journey into the neuroscience of
Learning and Development as you started and only you know where you are
now. I know in writing and updating the book I've discovered new
concepts, rethought my practice, reinforced some old learning and
reminded myself of things I used to do and would like to do again. I
shall continue my journey of discovery and invite you to continue yours
too.

[]{#17_CHAP_C17.xhtml_page_297 .pagebreak aria-label="Page 297"
role="doc-pagebreak"}I hope you've got some new ideas to test and that
you may have had your thinking challenged too. I trust you'll go and
experiment with what you have learnt to see what results you get. Behave
like a scientist and learn from others, experiment yourself and adjust
the variables; if the results aren't what you expect then analyse what
it was that caused the variance. Perhaps you've started encouraging
people to pay attention far more effectively but you're still not giving
them opportunities to embed learning by reviewing because you've not
designed it in, or you get pushed for time. Perhaps you went for a quick
win like thinking 'I'll get people moving' after an hour of PowerPoint,
but is that really taking into account everything you've read about the
neuroscience of learning? Perhaps you're thinking about neuroscience in
the context of creating digital learning and you're not sure how or
whether it applies. Perhaps you wonder whether culturally it will be
different in other countries or societies.

Despite the fact every single brain is different, because we've all been
wired differently through our life experiences, there are more
similarities than differences in the way your brain and mine process
information and learn. There's a similar pattern to the neuroscience of
learning for all of us. The biggest thing we know currently is that
there's far more we don't know than we do know so let's continue the
journey because it's hugely exciting.

Thank you for accompanying me on this journey of exploration and enjoy
learning for yourself and working with your learners. Let me know how
you get on.
